# `authenticated-map` State Machine

`authenticated-map` is Yano X's plugin-provided, proof-oriented registry for multiple
named collections. Each collection has its own authorization policy, key/value
bounds, value encoding, and optional value validator. Every active entry or
revocation tombstone is threshold-finalized and individually provable against
the app-chain state root.

It is a general authenticated data structure, not a relational database or a
document store. It does not provide secondary indexes, joins, range queries,
confidentiality, or cross-entry business rules.

## When to use it

Use `authenticated-map` when an application needs one or more independently
configured key/value namespaces with verifiable current state:

- product, asset, credential, or configuration registries;
- owner-controlled records with controller transfer and revocation;
- member-maintained canonical event or reference data;
- opaque hashes, attachments, encrypted values, or application-native bytes;
- atomic updates to several distinct keys; and
- records that need deterministic schema or application-specific validation.

Use `kv-registry` when one owner-guarded key/value namespace is enough. Use
`ordered-log` when append order matters more than current keyed state. Write a
composite or custom state machine when a transition must inspect several
existing entries, maintain secondary indexes, enforce relationships between
collections, emit effects, or implement a larger workflow.

## Collection and entry model

Genesis defines up to 64 collections. The important per-collection options
are:

| Option | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `id` | Stable lowercase collection identifier |
| `authorization` | `open`, `owner`, `member`, `governed-role`, or `approval` mutation policy |
| `authorizationPolicy` | Stable direct-role or approval policy id; required only by governed modes |
| `restoreAllowed` | Whether a revoked tombstone may become active again |
| `maxKeyBytes` | Maximum application-key size |
| `maxValueBytes` | Maximum value size |
| `valueEncoding` | `opaque` or `canonical-cbor` |
| `validator` | Optional genesis-bound schema or plugin descriptor id |

`open` permits any authenticated sender. `owner` records the first successful
creator as the 32-byte controller and permits later mutations only from that
controller. `member` requires the sender to be an active app-chain member at
the finalized height. `governed-role` requires a current actor with the role
named by its direct policy and a one-use signature over the complete action.
`approval` requires a terminal role-approval proposal for that exact action and
consumes the proposal atomically with the mutation. Only an `owner` collection
supports controller transfer.

Member keys remain consensus/relay identities. Governed authorization uses
separate domain actors, organizations, rotatable actor keys, and immutable
policy revisions. Any active member may relay actor-signed evidence, but the
relay gains no business authority and cannot alter the signed action.

An entry contains status (`ACTIVE` or `REVOKED`), revision, optional
controller, value, logical value hash, creation height, and last-mutation
height. Revocation retains a tombstone and the last logical value hash, but
removes the value bytes. Absence and revocation are therefore distinct and
provable states.

The mutation operations are:

| Operation | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `PUT` | Create an absent entry or replace an active value |
| `PUT_IF_ABSENT` | Create only when no entry or tombstone exists |
| `COMPARE_AND_SET` | Replace an active value after revision and/or value-hash checks |
| `TRANSFER_CONTROLLER` | Change an active owner collection's controller |
| `REVOKE` | Replace an active entry with a tombstone |
| `RESTORE` | Restore a tombstone when the collection permits it |

A command contains either one mutation or a bounded batch. A batch cannot
touch the same collection/key twice and is applied atomically: if any mutation
fails, none of its entry changes are written. For a command that reaches state
application, a retained receipt records the applied results or one
deterministic rejection code. Candidate-validation failures are filtered
before finalization and therefore have no receipt.

## Configuration

The recommended path is the authenticated-map project recipe. Bootstrap member
keys are required because membership, consensus settings, collection rules,
validators, and the state-commitment profile are all committed by genesis:

```bash
./yano.sh appchain init --non-interactive \
  --recipe authenticated-map --network preprod --members 3 \
  --member-key <member-0-64-hex> \
  --member-key <member-1-64-hex> \
  --member-key <member-2-64-hex> \
  --name product-registry --chain-id product-registry \
  --output product-registry
```

Configure `spec.chains[0].authenticatedMap` in the generated
`appchain.yaml`. This example combines an opaque collection, canonical CBOR,
and a declarative product schema:

```yaml
authenticatedMap:
  profile: mpf-blake2b256-v1
  anchorPolicyCommitment: "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
  maxBatchItems: 32
  maxBatchBytes: 65536
  collections:
    - id: attachments
      authorization: owner
      restoreAllowed: false
      maxKeyBytes: 64
      maxValueBytes: 1048576
      valueEncoding: opaque
    - id: canonical-events
      authorization: member
      restoreAllowed: false
      maxKeyBytes: 64
      maxValueBytes: 16384
      valueEncoding: canonical-cbor
    - id: products
      authorization: owner
      restoreAllowed: false
      maxKeyBytes: 64
      maxValueBytes: 4096
      valueEncoding: canonical-cbor
      validator: product-v1
  schemas:
    - id: product-v1
      root: product
      source: |
        product = {
          sku: tstr .size (1..32),
          quantity: uint .le 1000000,
          status: "active" / "held" / "retired",
          ? note: tstr .size (0..256)
        }
```

To use `governed-role` or `approval`, add a stable policy id to the collection
and provide a closed genesis actor/policy set. This abridged direct-role example
shows the public shape; substitute the generated lowercase hex values before
rendering:

```yaml
authenticatedMap:
  collections:
    - id: regulated-products
      authorization: governed-role
      authorizationPolicy: issuer-write
      restoreAllowed: false
      maxKeyBytes: 64
      maxValueBytes: 4096
      valueEncoding: canonical-cbor
  authorizationGovernance:
    authorityId: registry-admins
    initialRevision: 1
    administratorActors: [admin-a]
    threshold: 1
    maximumMutationLifetimeBlocks: 1000
  genesisRecords:
    organizations:
      - id: manufacturer-a
        revision: 1
        status: active
    actors:
      - id: admin-a
        revision: 1
        organization: manufacturer-a
        status: active
        roles: [registry-admin, issuer]
        keys:
          - id: admin-a-v1
            algorithm: ed25519
            publicKey: "${ADMIN_PUBLIC_KEY}"
            proofOfPossession: "${ADMIN_POP_SIGNATURE}"
            validFromHeight: 1
            validUntilHeight: 0
            status: active
    directPolicies:
      - id: issuer-write
        revision: 1
        status: active
        requiredRole: issuer
        maximumAuthorizationLifetimeBlocks: 100
    approvalPolicies: []
```

Generate the public key and the raw proof-of-possession signature offline. The
seed remains in the caller-controlled file and is never written to the project:

```bash
ADMIN_PUBLIC_KEY="$(./yano.sh appchain role public-key \
  --seed-file /owner-only/admin-a.seed)"
ADMIN_POP_SIGNATURE="$(./yano.sh appchain role key-proof-signature \
  --chain product-registry \
  --actor admin-a --actor-revision 1 --key admin-a-v1 \
  --public-key "$ADMIN_PUBLIC_KEY" \
  --valid-from-height 1 --valid-until-height 0 \
  --seed-file /owner-only/admin-a.seed)"
```

An approval policy uses `proposerRoles` plus one or more clauses. Each clause
sets a role, minimum count, and `distinctBy: actor|organization`; for example,
two `auditor` actors from distinct organizations:

```yaml
approvalPolicies:
  - id: product-release
    revision: 1
    status: active
    proposerRoles: [issuer]
    clauses:
      - id: independent-auditors
        role: auditor
        minimumCount: 2
        distinctBy: organization
    rejectionMode: any-eligible
    maximumLifetimeBlocks: 500
```

Every referenced organization, actor, key and policy must be revision 1,
canonical, active, proof-of-possession valid, and inside the configured bounds.
The renderer refuses an invalid genesis closure. `authorizationLimits` can
lower the committed evidence, genesis, pending-index, expiry, query-page and
crypto-work maxima; omitted values use the release defaults.

For an intentionally post-genesis policy, list an `onboarding` item instead of
pretending the collection is ready:

```yaml
onboarding:
  - kind: approval-policy
    id: product-release
    note: activate before enabling release submissions
```

The collection remains fail closed until governance activates that policy.
`appchain doctor` reports `GOVERNED_COLLECTION_NOT_BOOTSTRAPPED` and names the
planned item; the renderer writes `bootstrap/authenticated-map-onboarding.yaml`
as an operational plan, not as consensus state.

Then render and verify the exact release:

```bash
./yano.sh appchain render product-registry
./yano.sh appchain doctor product-registry --distribution /path/to/yano-release.zip
```

The renderer emits the canonical genesis plus the three matching runtime
settings: `state.commitment-profile`, `state.format-fingerprint`, and
`state.genesis-id`. Do not hand-edit those values. Every member must use the
same generated chain configuration and validator artifacts.

`anchorPolicyCommitment` is consensus identity. The all-zero value is an
explicit development/no-policy placeholder; replace it with the reviewed
32-byte commitment before creating an anchored production chain generation.

The available commitment profiles are `mpf-blake2b256-v1` and
`jmt-blake2b256-v1`. The Poseidon JMT profile is reserved until its pinned
implementation is released.

## Value encoding and validation

Validation is optional and the default is `opaque` with no validator.

- `opaque` accepts any bounded byte sequence. Use it for encrypted values,
  hashes, attachments, or an application format already made deterministic.
- `canonical-cbor` requires exactly one bounded deterministic CBOR item. It
  accepts integers, byte/text strings, definite-length arrays, and
  definite-length maps, subject to canonical ordering and bounds. It rejects
  indefinite-length values, trailing bytes, non-minimal encodings, duplicate
  or incorrectly ordered map keys, invalid UTF-8, and unsupported tags or
  simple values.
- A declarative schema adds exact record-shape and field constraints using the
  supported `cddl-yano-subset-v1`; nodes execute its canonical compiled IR.
- A validator plugin adds a deterministic application-specific predicate over
  `(collectionId, applicationKey, value)`.

These rules are consensus-bound. Changing an encoding, schema, plugin,
parameters, or pinned plugin artifact creates a different genesis identity and
requires a new chain generation with an explicit migration plan.

For detailed schema syntax, offline preflight, validator descriptors, error
codes, and the plugin trust model, see
[Authenticated-map value validation](authenticated-map-validation.md).

## Run the showcase

The light showcase includes `authenticated-map-chain` with four collections:

| Collection | Authorization | Encoding and validation |
|---|---|---|
| `attachments` | owner | opaque bytes |
| `canonical-events` | member | canonical-CBOR array |
| `products` | owner | canonical-CBOR map plus `product-v1` schema |
| `gtins` | owner | canonical-CBOR text plus first-party `gs1-gtin-v1` plugin |

Start it and run the dedicated scenario:

```bash
./showcase.sh quickstart --profile light --nodes 3 --instance authmap-demo
./demos/submit-authenticated-map.sh authmap-demo
```

The scenario writes one value to every collection, demonstrates pre-finality
rejection by the product schema and GTIN plugin, performs a root-attested point
query, and retrieves the native MPF proof. The launcher generates the
authenticated-map genesis from the actual bootstrap member keys and the
validator bundle digest in that exact Yano release.

## Submit through REST

The topic is `authenticated-map.command.v1`. Use the packaged showcase codec
to create canonical command and value bytes; curl still sends the normal public
HTTP request:

```bash
BASE=http://127.0.0.1:7070
CODEC=./tools/showcase_codec.py

VALUE_HEX="$(python3 "$CODEC" authmap-value product sku-42 5 active \
  'demo product')"
BODY_HEX="$(python3 "$CODEC" authmap put products sku-42 "$VALUE_HEX")"

RESPONSE="$(curl -fsS -X POST \
  "$BASE/api/v1/app-chain/chains/authenticated-map-chain/messages" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "$(jq -nc --arg body "$BODY_HEX" \
    '{topic:"authenticated-map.command.v1",bodyHex:$body}')")"
MESSAGE_ID="$(printf '%s' "$RESPONSE" | jq -r .messageId)"
```

HTTP `202` proves only ingress/pool acceptance, not state-machine acceptance or
a successful finalized mutation. Encoding, schema, and plugin validation runs
again when forming the candidate block; an invalid message can therefore
receive `202`, then be filtered before finalization without changing state or
creating an authenticated receipt. Use local preflight for immediate advisory
feedback, and always wait for finality before treating a mutation as applied.
The generic query endpoint accepts the canonical point-query bytes:

```bash
until curl -fsS \
  "$BASE/api/v1/app-chain/chains/authenticated-map-chain/messages/$MESSAGE_ID" \
  >/dev/null 2>&1; do sleep 1; done

RECEIPT_HEX="$(python3 "$CODEC" authmap-receipt "$MESSAGE_ID")"
curl -fsS -X POST \
  "$BASE/api/v1/app-chain/chains/authenticated-map-chain/query/authenticated-map/receipt-v1" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "$(jq -nc --arg params "$RECEIPT_HEX" '{paramsHex:$params}')" | jq .

QUERY_HEX="$(python3 "$CODEC" authmap query products sku-42)"
curl -fsS -X POST \
  "$BASE/api/v1/app-chain/chains/authenticated-map-chain/query/authenticated-map/entry-v1" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "$(jq -nc --arg params "$QUERY_HEX" '{paramsHex:$params}')" | jq .
```

For a direct state-inclusion proof, derive the physical state key:

```bash
STATE_KEY_HEX="$(python3 "$CODEC" authmap state-key products sku-42)"
curl -fsS \
  "$BASE/api/v1/app-chain/chains/authenticated-map-chain/state/proof/$STATE_KEY_HEX" \
  | jq .
```

Verify the proof locally and bind its root to an independently trusted finality
certificate or Cardano anchor at an audit boundary.

## Governed authoring and external signing

A governed command commits to the complete ordered action: every collection,
key, operation, value, precondition, controller, authorization kind, stable
policy id, evidence handle, and covered mutation index. Evidence handles are
one-based; `0` means no evidence for `open`, `owner`, or `member`. The same
evidence item may cover several declared mutation indexes, but its coverage
must be exact.

The packaged CLI assembles canonical bytes and never reads a direct-role
private key. For one `governed-role` mutation whose first evidence item is the
actor authorization:

```bash
ACTION_HEX="$(./yano.sh appchain authenticated-map action \
  --command-hex "$BASIC_COMMAND_HEX" \
  --assignments '0:governed-role:issuer-write:1')"

PREIMAGE_HEX="$(./yano.sh appchain authenticated-map direct-preimage \
  --action-hex "$ACTION_HEX" \
  --authorization-id "$UNIQUE_32_BYTE_ID_HEX" \
  --chain product-registry --genesis-id "$GENESIS_ID_HEX" \
  --indexes 0 --policy issuer-write --policy-revision 1 \
  --actor issuer-a --actor-revision 1 --key issuer-a-v1 \
  --public-key "$ISSUER_PUBLIC_KEY" \
  --issued-height "$CURRENT_HEIGHT" --deadline-height "$DEADLINE_HEIGHT")"

# Sign PREIMAGE_HEX with the actor's Ed25519 key in the caller's wallet/HSM.
SIGNATURE_HEX="$(external-ed25519-signer "$PREIMAGE_HEX")"

EVIDENCE_HEX="$(./yano.sh appchain authenticated-map direct-complete \
  --action-hex "$ACTION_HEX" \
  --authorization-id "$UNIQUE_32_BYTE_ID_HEX" \
  --chain product-registry --genesis-id "$GENESIS_ID_HEX" \
  --indexes 0 --policy issuer-write --policy-revision 1 \
  --actor issuer-a --actor-revision 1 --key issuer-a-v1 \
  --public-key "$ISSUER_PUBLIC_KEY" \
  --issued-height "$CURRENT_HEIGHT" --deadline-height "$DEADLINE_HEIGHT" \
  --signature "$SIGNATURE_HEX")"

GOVERNED_COMMAND_HEX="$(./yano.sh appchain authenticated-map command \
  --action-hex "$ACTION_HEX" --evidence-hex "$EVIDENCE_HEX")"
```

`direct-complete` verifies the returned signature against the claimed public
key before emitting evidence. Submit `GOVERNED_COMMAND_HEX` on
`authenticated-map.command.v1`. A successful action consumes
`(actorId, authorizationId)` exactly once; reuse is a deterministic replay
rejection even if a different member relays it.

For an `approval` collection, derive the proposal payload with
`authenticated-map approval-payload --action-hex ... --genesis-id ...`. Actors
sign `PROPOSE` and `APPROVE` statements for payload domain
`yano.authenticated-map.action.v1` through the offline `appchain role sign`
flow and submit them on `role-approvals.command.v1`. Only after the exact
proposal is terminal `APPROVED`, create its one-based evidence item with
`authenticated-map approval-reference`, assemble the final map command, and
submit it. Successful execution consumes the proposal id globally and
atomically with every mutation; threshold approval never auto-executes.

## Submit from Java

Use `yano-x-stdlib-contracts` for the portable wire contract and
`appchain-client` for submission, queries, and proof verification:

```java
AppChainClient raw = AppChainClient.builder("http://127.0.0.1:7070/api/v1")
        .chainId("product-registry")
        .apiKey(System.getenv("YANO_API_KEY"))
        .build();
StdlibAppChainClient map = new StdlibAppChainClient(raw);

byte[] key = "sku-42".getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
byte[] value = productCbor(); // one canonical CBOR value matching product-v1

var mutation = AuthenticatedMapContract.Mutation.put("products", key, value);
var submitted = map.authenticatedMapMutate(mutation);

var point = map.authenticatedMapEntry("products", key);
var proof = map.authenticatedMapProof("products", key);
var receipt = map.authenticatedMapReceipt(
        HexFormat.of().parseHex(submitted.messageId()));
```

For race-safe writes, use `compareAndSet` with the revision and/or logical value
hash from the last trusted entry. Use `authenticatedMapBatch` for an atomic
list of distinct collection/key mutations. Application-side preflight can
reuse the exact genesis encoding/schema rules, but authoritative validation
still occurs independently on every node.

Governed Java applications use `AuthenticatedMapAuthoring` to keep signing
outside the client process:

```java
var command = AuthenticatedMapContract.Command.single(mutation);
var action = AuthenticatedMapAuthoring.action(command, List.of(
        new AuthenticatedMapAuthorizationContract.AuthorizationAssignmentV1(
                0, AuthenticatedMapContract.AUTH_GOVERNED_ROLE,
                "issuer-write", 1)));

var request = AuthenticatedMapAuthoring.directSigningRequest(
        authorizationId, "product-registry", genesisId, action, List.of(0),
        "issuer-write", 1, "issuer-a", 1, "issuer-a-v1", publicKey,
        currentHeight, deadlineHeight);
byte[] signature = externalSigner.sign(request.signingPreimage());
var evidence = AuthenticatedMapAuthoring.completeDirectSignature(
        request, signature);

map.authenticatedMapGovernedCommand(AuthenticatedMapAuthoring.command(
        action, List.of(evidence)));
```

Approval helpers construct the exact proposal statement and approval reference;
`StdlibAppChainClient` submits signed approval, actor-governance, and
policy-governance commands on their versioned topics. The SDK never infers a
policy revision or silently signs with a node/member key.

## Domain API and composite proofs

The first-party bundle publishes read-only routes below
`/api/v1/plugins/org.yanoproject.x.stdlib/`. Set `chain=<id>`
when a node hosts more than one app chain. Important routes include:

| Route | Result |
|---|---|
| `authenticated-map` | Genesis identity, profile, collections, authorization capabilities |
| `authenticated-map/entries/{collection}/{keyHex}` | Exact entry, absence, or tombstone |
| `authenticated-map/receipts/{messageIdHex}` | Receipt and complete action commitment |
| `authenticated-map/direct-consumptions/{actor}/{authorizationIdHex}` | One-use actor claim |
| `authenticated-map/approval-consumptions/{proposal}` | One-use proposal claim |
| `authenticated-map/direct-policies/{id}` | Current or `?revision=` direct policy |
| `authenticated-map/administrator-authorities/{id}` | Current or historical authority |
| `authenticated-map/pending/approvals` | Bounded `?after=&limit=` pending page |
| `authenticated-map/pending/actor-governance` | Bounded actor-governance page |
| `authenticated-map/pending/policy-governance` | Bounded policy-governance page |

The same bundle also composes the exact organization, actor, approval-policy,
proposal, and statistics routes from the role workflow API. Every exact-record
response names the chain/API/state-machine identity, height/root, physical
proof key, canonical leaf value, and—when it asserts currency—the
current-pointer key/value. Pending pages instead return `sourceIndexProofKey`
and canonical `queryValue`, explicitly labelled as a bounded index-derived
view; they do not mislabel page bytes as a Merkle leaf. JSON is presentation
only; verify canonical record values and native proofs.

`AuthenticatedMapProofBundle` verifies a bounded same-root assembly for
`BASIC`, `DIRECT_ROLE`, `APPROVAL`, or `ADMINISTRATOR_GOVERNANCE`. It rejects
mixed chain/profile/genesis/root/height facts, wrong physical namespaces,
receipt-to-entry substitution, missing current pointers, wrong revisions,
invalid actor/administrator signatures, unsatisfied approval clauses, and
consumption/action mismatches. Use `verify(trustedRoot)` with an independently
trusted exact root, or `verifyCertified(...)` with pinned finality membership.
A later-root proof establishes retention, not historical currency; use the
decision/execution root when the bundle must prove that a pointer was current.

## Attach a custom validator format

An application can enforce its own deterministic value format without adding
a new `valueEncoding` name:

- use `opaque` plus a plugin when the plugin owns all format parsing; or
- use `canonical-cbor` plus a plugin when canonical CBOR should be enforced
  before the application rule.

Implement `AuthenticatedMapValueValidatorFactory` from `core-api`, register it
through `ServiceLoader` and a Yano plugin manifest, and return only `ACCEPT` or
`REJECT` from a total, deterministic validator. The plugin descriptor in
genesis pins the provider id, SPI contract version, canonical parameters, and
the exact `ARTIFACT_CLOSURE` SHA-256. The bundle must also be present in the
runtime catalog and explicitly allow-listed on every node.

Validator plugins are trusted in-process consensus code, not sandboxed uploads.
They must not depend on filesystem, network, clock, randomness, locale,
environment, mutable global state, or node-local configuration. If a rule must
read app-chain state or relate several entries, it belongs in a custom or
composite state machine instead of a value validator.

The light showcase's `gs1-gtin-v1` validator is a working reference for this
extension path. Attaching a different plugin to an existing chain is not a hot
configuration change; it creates a new chain generation.

## Operational boundaries

Collection definitions, validation rules, maximum batch limits, consensus
profile, bootstrap membership digest, and anchor-policy commitment are all
chain-generation identity. Review and archive the rendered genesis before
launch, keep plugin artifacts byte-identical across nodes, and fail deployment
when a digest or provider is unavailable.

Authenticated state proves which bytes finalized under those rules. It does
not prove that a real-world assertion is true, make public values confidential,
or preserve old command bodies forever. Archive application evidence
separately when historical availability is required.
