# App-Chain State-Machine References

These pages are capability references for Yano's deterministic application
state machines. Use the [stock state-machine cookbook](../tutorials/03-stock-state-machines.md)
for a quick comparison.

| State machine | Reference |
|---|---|
| `ordered-log` | [Opaque ordered events, topics, proofs, and customization](../../core-host.md) |
| `kv-registry` | [Owned mutable records, REST/Java usage, and proofs](kv-registry.md) |
| `authenticated-map` | [Proof-oriented multi-collection registry](authenticated-map.md) ([value validation](authenticated-map-validation.md)) |
| `approvals` | [Member decisions, REST/Java usage, proofs, and effects](approvals.md) |
| `balances` | [Member-authorized minting, transfers, Java/Spring usage, and proofs](balances.md) |
| `doc-trail` | [Per-entity document hashes, REST/Java usage, and proofs](doc-trail.md) |
| `role-approvals` | [Governed business actors, role policies, signed decisions, and proofs](role-approvals.md) |

Exact wire formats and deterministic state layouts are also described in the
[consensus guide](../../core-host.md).
