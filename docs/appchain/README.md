# Yano App Chains — Start Here

This is the task-oriented entry point for Yano app chains. It is designed for
two kinds of reader:

- **New to app chains:** start a local three-member chain, submit useful data,
  and see what is finalized before learning the internals.
- **Experienced distributed-systems or blockchain developer:** jump directly
  to state proofs, L1 anchoring, deterministic composition, effects, plugins,
  governance, and operational boundaries.

The tutorials use the current source tree. Yano is still pre-release; use local
devnet or a Cardano test network, disposable application data, and non-production
credentials unless a guide explicitly says otherwise.

## Choose your first outcome

If you are unsure, complete tutorials 1, 2, 4, and 5 in that order. They show
the progression from a replicated log to proofs, external actions, and
business-role authorization.

## What ships out of the box

| Availability | Capabilities |
|---|---|
| Bundled deterministic state | `ordered-log`, `kv-registry`, `authenticated-map`, `approvals`, `balances`, `doc-trail`, `role-approvals`, evidence registry/profile |
| Bundled external delivery | `webhook.post` effect executor and finalized webhook sink |
| First-party optional | Kafka effect/sink, S3-compatible `object.put`, `ipfs.pin`, `cardano.payment` |
| Experimental optional | ZK gate, anonymous membership and credential registry |
| Reference | Custom JVM plugin workflow and the complete evidence demo environment |

Deterministic state runs identically on every member and contributes to the
state root. External executors run after the relevant finality gate and report
an outcome through the effect system. External execution is at-least-once;
effect outcome incorporation is exactly once. Receivers must honor the supplied
idempotency identity.

“First-party optional” means maintained and tested by Yano X, but not selected
in every deployment. Install the release-matched JVM bundle. Yano X extensions
are not part of Yano's native image. See the exact
[capability catalog](CAPABILITIES.md) and
[connector installation guide](OPTIONAL_CONNECTORS.md).

## The mental model

An app chain has four layers:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    C[Client command] --> M[Deterministic state machine]
    M --> F[Threshold-finalized app block]
    F --> P[State root and MPF proofs]
    P --> A[Cardano L1 anchor]
    M -. effect intent .-> E[Effect runtime]
    E --> X[Kafka, S3, IPFS, webhook, Cardano]
    X -. acknowledged result .-> M
```

1. A member authenticates and relays a command.
2. The proposer orders commands into an app block.
3. A threshold of members signs the same block and state root.
4. State and effect intents become provable against that root.
5. An optional anchor settles the root on Cardano.
6. Effect executors act outside consensus and report bounded outcomes.

For role-aware workflows, the relay member and the business actor are separate
identities: a node transports a command; an actor signature authorizes its
business meaning.

## Learning tracks

### Beginner: operate first, understand second

1. Use the self-contained devnet. No Cardano funds or external node is needed.
2. Submit through `./yano.sh appchain cluster` rather than constructing wire bytes.
3. Compare tips and roots on all members.
4. Inspect one proof and one intentional no-op/failure.
5. Stop while keeping data, restart, and verify the same state.

### Application developer

1. Choose a stock machine or committed composite profile.
2. Use the Java client or REST API for typed commands and proof queries.
3. Add a small composite plugin when existing components need new ordering or
   terminal transitions.
4. Add a custom state-machine plugin only for genuinely new state or rules.
5. Treat any change to deterministic application semantics as a versioned
   consensus upgrade, not an ordinary rolling code change.

### Platform and security engineer

1. Verify finality certificates and MPF proofs independently.
2. Choose metadata or threshold-script anchoring and define the finality gate.
3. Separate member keys, business-actor keys, API keys, effect credentials, and
   anchor funds.
4. Pin the binary, plugin catalog, committed profile, runtime, and connector
   security profiles across members.
5. Exercise restart, catch-up, restore, executor retry, and root-parity gates.

## Prerequisites used by the tutorials

- Java 25 when building from source.
- Docker Desktop for the complete evidence/connector demo.
- `bash`, `curl`, `jq`, `python3`, and `openssl`.
- From source, build the runnable application once:

```bash
./gradlew :app:quarkusBuild -PskipSigning=true
```

The cluster launcher can also use a released Yano tree; see
[`scripts/appchain-cluster/README.md`](../../scripts/appchain-cluster/README.md).

## A note on “no code”

No-code means the required state machine, composite, connector, and launcher
already ship with Yano. A real application still sends typed commands and owns
its UI, identity onboarding, key custody, and business data. Configuration
cannot invent arbitrary consensus transitions. New combinations use a small
composite plugin; new domain logic uses a custom state-machine plugin.
