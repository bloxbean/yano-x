# Tutorial 8 — Extend Yano Without Forking It

[Open the custom-plugin path in App-Chain Studio](../../../tooling/studio/src/main/web/index.html#recipe=custom-plugin&network=devnet&members=3&finality=two-thirds&sequencing=fixed&runtime=jvm&deployment=host&name=custom-appchain&chainId=custom-appchain&stateMachine=com.example.my-machine)

- **Level:** Java application developer
- **Time:** 30–60 minutes for a first plugin
- **Outcome:** choose the correct extension level and deploy versioned business
  logic as a plugin JAR on the standard JVM distribution.

## Start from a bounded scaffold

Use the public launcher to create one small, buildable starting point. The
four modes share the same runtime manifest, signed product-catalog, and
ServiceLoader conventions:

Use the exact host version from your distribution manifest for
`<matching-yano-host-version>`; the host and Yano X have separate versions.

```bash
./yano.sh appchain plugin scaffold \
  --mode state-machine \
  --id shipment \
  --package com.example.shipment \
  --yano-version <matching-yano-host-version> \
  --output shipment-plugin
```

Other modes are `composite-role`, `effect-executor`, and `sink`. The generated
provider deliberately performs no business work: state-machine admission is
closed and executor/sink factories return no instances until implemented.
The tool refuses a non-empty output directory.

After implementation and tests, sign the exact catalog, runtime manifest, and
optional configuration metadata. Keep the 32-byte seed outside the repository
and pass it by file only:

```bash
./yano.sh appchain plugin sign \
  --catalog shipment-plugin/src/main/resources/META-INF/yano/appchain-component-catalog-v1.json \
  --runtime-manifest shipment-plugin/src/main/resources/META-INF/yano/plugins/plugin-bundle.shipment.json \
  --seed-file /secure/publisher.seed \
  --key-id example-release-2026 \
  --output shipment-plugin/src/main/resources/META-INF/yano/appchain-component-catalog-v1.sig.json

cd shipment-plugin
gradle jar
cd ..

./yano.sh appchain plugin validate shipment-plugin/build/libs/shipment-yano-plugin.jar \
  --trust-key example-release-2026=<64-hex-public-key> \
  --output shipment-catalog.json
```

`inspect` prints the same verified catalog and its capabilities. Neither
command loads provider classes, runs plugin code, fetches a registry, or
installs the JAR. The exported snapshot is the safe local-import format used
by Studio and generated projects.

Create a project by selecting the custom capability declared by the catalog:

```bash
./yano.sh appchain init --non-interactive \
  --recipe custom-plugin --network devnet --members 3 --runtime jvm \
  --capability state:shipment \
  --plugin-jar shipment-plugin/build/libs/shipment-yano-plugin.jar \
  --trust-key example-release-2026=<64-hex-public-key> \
  --output shipment-chain

./yano.sh appchain config validate --mode project shipment-chain
```

The project stores the signed data-only snapshot under
`component-catalogs/`; its lock pins the snapshot, catalog, runtime manifest,
configuration metadata, and complete plugin-JAR digests. Rendering and doctor
reverify the project snapshot automatically. The public key is not secret.
Copy the exact pinned JAR into `plugins/` in every JVM distribution before
starting nodes, then verify it:

```bash
./yano.sh appchain doctor shipment-chain --distribution /opt/yano
```

A missing or different JAR fails artifact readiness. A native distribution
reports a direct incompatibility because Yano X plugins target the JVM host.

Yano's core provides ordering, threshold finality, deterministic state,
proofs, anchoring, effects, plugin lifecycle, health, and metrics. Application
teams normally extend the application layer, not the consensus runtime.

## Choose the smallest extension

```text
Does a stock machine/profile already model the outcome?
  ├─ yes → configuration only
  └─ no
      Are all required components already available?
        ├─ yes → small composite plugin
        └─ no  → custom state-machine component/plugin
```

Other independent plugin SPIs cover effect executors, finalized stream sinks,
domain APIs, signers, sequencer mode, and L1 observers.

## Path A — configuration only

Select one built-in id or profile identically on every member:

```yaml
yano.app-chain.state-machine: kv-registry
```

For stock composite/role profiles, the profile identifier and configuration
digest become part of chain identity. Select them only for a fresh chain or a
governed activation.

## Path B — a small composite plugin

A composite explicitly defines:

- component ids and versions;
- deterministic application order;
- routed public topics;
- per-component quotas;
- workflow transitions between components; and
- one committed profile identity/digest.

This Java class is intentionally small but consensus-critical. YAML cannot
dynamically insert arbitrary component plugins into a frozen profile, because
two members discovering a different order would derive different roots.

Reuse the effect-gated evidence and role-evidence presets as reference
implementations. Package the provider, manifest, service entry, and components
in one reviewed bundle.

## Path C — a custom state-machine plugin

The complete hands-on implementation is in the existing
[default-distribution tutorial, Part 2](../../APP_CHAIN_TUTORIAL.md). The core
shape is:

```java
public final class ShipmentStateMachine implements AppStateMachine {
    @Override
    public String id() {
        return "shipment-v1";
    }

    @Override
    public AdmissionResult validate(AppMessage message) {
        // Bounded structural validation only; never perform I/O here.
        return decodeSafely(message.getBody())
                ? AdmissionResult.accept()
                : AdmissionResult.reject("invalid shipment command");
    }

    @Override
    public void apply(AppBlock block, AppStateWriter state) {
        // Deterministic bounded transitions only.
    }
}
```

Contribute it through `AppStateMachineProvider`, add the service entry and
plugin manifest, then copy the bundle JAR into the configured plugin directory.
Yano itself does not need recompilation for a JVM deployment.

Yano X plugins target the JVM distribution. Yano's native image cannot discover
directory JARs and does not include Yano X plugins.

## Custom component catalog contract

The JAR carries three independent, bounded contracts:

- `META-INF/yano/plugins/<bundle-id>.json` describes executable runtime
  contributions;
- `META-INF/yano/appchain-config-metadata-v1.json`, when present, owns typed
  configuration definitions; and
- `META-INF/yano/appchain-component-catalog-v1.json` describes selectable
  product capabilities and required artifacts.

The Ed25519 trust envelope binds the catalog, runtime manifest, optional
configuration metadata, bundle identity/version, and publisher key ID. It
authenticates those exact bytes; it does not approve code or elevate a custom
component to bundled/stable/native status. Custom entries remain JVM-only
`REFERENCE` or `EXPERIMENTAL`, and all release ID, namespace, and artifact
collisions fail closed.

## Consensus rules for application plugins

- The same bundle, machine/profile id, and committed settings run on every
  voting member.
- `apply()` must not use wall clock, randomness, DNS, filesystem, database, or
  network I/O.
- Invalid finalized bytes become deterministic no-ops, not escaping
  exceptions.
- Bound message bytes, decode depth/items, collections, state growth, and work
  per block.
- Never silently change semantics behind an existing machine/component id.
- Use activation heights/profile governance for compatible evolution and a
  new namespace/migration plan for incompatible state.
- Every state write belongs to the authenticated writer; do not maintain
  hidden consensus state in static fields or node-local storage.

## Add external actions correctly

Do not call Kafka, S3, IPFS, Cardano, or an ERP from `apply()`. Emit an
`EffectIntent`; let an executor act after its finality gate; incorporate the
result through `onEffectResult` when the outcome affects business state.

Create a custom executor plugin when the action needs typed target aliases,
authentication, polling, reconciliation, or a domain-specific receipt. Keep
endpoints and secrets in node-local executor configuration, never replicated
effect payloads.

## Testing ladder

1. Unit-test codecs and deterministic transitions.
2. Run the state-machine conformance and replay matrix.
3. Test malformed and hostile finalized input through `apply()`.
4. Start an embedded multi-member cluster with `appchain-testkit`.
5. Verify root parity, proof keys, restart, catch-up, rollback/reapply, and
   plugin packaging.
6. For effects, test crash-before-send, send-before-ack, retry, reconciliation,
   parking, requeue, and duplicate idempotency.
7. Run a packaged JVM cluster; add native coverage when native is supported.

## Deployment and operations

- Give every bundle a stable plugin id and semantic version.
- Verify catalog state and health on every member before admitting traffic.
- Treat plugin removal or drift as a deployment error, not automatic fallback.
- Namespace configuration and metrics by plugin/contribution.
- Keep plugin domain APIs read-only unless commands still enter through the
  authenticated app-chain submission path.
