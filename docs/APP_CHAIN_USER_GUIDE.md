Yano can run an **app chain** next to Cardano L1: a sequenced, replicated,
application-specific ledger maintained by a known-member, permissioned group
of Yano nodes. The current pilot posture assumes trusted member operators;
semi-trusted deployments require the additional co-attestation and independent
outcome-auditing controls tracked in the app-layer open-items document. The same
node keeps syncing/serving Cardano L1; the app chain runs
in parallel over the same node-to-node protocol stack (a CIP-137-derived
"appmsg" mini-protocol family), commits its state into a Merkle Patricia
Forestry (MPF) trie, and periodically **anchors the state root to Cardano L1**.

## Published modules

The default distribution bundles the app-chain core, standard state machines,
generic composite and role products, and the preview evidence product. Client
libraries are application dependencies; Kafka, S3, IPFS, Cardano and ZK are
separately installed JVM plugin bundles (group id
`com.bloxbean.cardano`):

| Artifact | Repo path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `yano-x-stdlib` | `state-machines/stdlib` | Ready state machines, selected by id (§9); ships in the distribution |
| `yano-x-composite` | `composition/runtime` | Bundled generic deterministic composition/profile framework; not arbitrary YAML composition |
| `yano-x-role-workflow` | `capabilities/role-workflow` | Bundled preview `role-approvals` provider and generic role domain API |
| `yano-x-evidence-profile` | `products/evidence/profile` | Bundled preview evidence and role-evidence profiles |
| `yano-x-client` | `sdk/client` | Java client SDK: REST + SSE + client-side proof verification (§16) |
| `yano-x-composite-client` | `composition/client` | Governed-profile finality, one-root MPF, epoch-chain, and authorization-policy verification |
| `yano-appchain-core-testkit` | [Yano `appchain/appchain-testkit`](https://github.com/bloxbean/yano/tree/main/appchain/appchain-testkit) | JUnit 5 `@AppChainCluster` embedded clusters for tests (§16) |
| `yano-x-integration-contracts` | `sdk/integration-contracts` | Provider-neutral connector payload, receipt, CDDL, and golden-vector contracts |
| `yano-x-kafka` | `connectors/kafka` | Node plugin: finalized blocks and acknowledged `kafka.publish` effects → Kafka topics (§10, §18) |
| `yano-x-objectstore-s3` | `connectors/objectstore-s3` | Node plugin: immutable/versioned `object.put` effects for tested S3-compatible stores (§18) |
| `yano-x-ipfs` | `connectors/ipfs` | Node plugin: reconciled pin-only `ipfs.pin` effects through a configured Kubo RPC (§18) |
| `yano-x-effects-cardano` | `connectors/effects-cardano` | Node plugin: Cardano payment executor for the effect system (§18) |

## 1. What you get out of the box

**Yes for bundled capabilities.** Enable an app chain with configuration flags
and typed commands; no custom state-machine code is required. Optional
connectors still require their release-matched plugin and external service:

- **Built-in state machine: `ordered-log`** (the default). Every submitted
  message is an opaque blob; the chain gives you a tamper-evident, totally
  ordered, replicated log of those blobs. For each finalized message it writes
  `message-id → (height, index, topic, sender)` into the MPF trie, so anyone
  can obtain an **inclusion proof** that a message was finalized at a given
  position — verifiable against the (anchorable) state root without trusting
  any node.
- **Bundled reusable products** — registry, member approvals, balances,
  document trails, generic role approvals, and preview evidence profiles —
  selected through a release-pinned recipe/capability catalog (section 9).
- **REST endpoints** to submit and read messages, browse blocks, and fetch
  proofs (section 4).
- **Sequencing with real finality**: fixed mode uses one configured proposer;
  rotating mode deterministically changes proposer over L1-slot windows. The
  active proposer batches messages into app blocks; every member re-executes the block,
  verifies the state root byte-for-byte and co-signs. A block is final only
  with a threshold **finality certificate** (n-of-members Ed25519 signatures,
  all verified).
- **L1 anchoring** (optional): the node itself builds, signs and submits either
  a metadata commitment or a threshold-co-signed script-anchor transaction,
  then confirms it through its own L1 sync. No external API/provider involved.
- **Catch-up**: a member that joins late or restarts behind fetches finalized
  blocks from peers (protocol 103) and verifies everything (hash chain,
  certificates, re-executed state roots) before committing.
- **Effects**: a finalized state transition can trigger an action *outside*
  the chain by emitting a provable record that an executor reports back
  on-chain (section 18). The webhook executor is bundled. Kafka, S3, IPFS and
  Cardano executors are first-party optional plugins.

Use the [release capability catalog](appchain/CAPABILITIES.md) for exact
availability, maturity, JVM/native posture and artifacts, and the
[optional-connector guide](appchain/OPTIONAL_CONNECTORS.md) before deployment.

Typical uses with zero code: multi-party audit/compliance logs, consortium
message queues with neutral custody, attestation feeds, document/DPP trails —
anything that needs "we all agree on this exact sequence of records, and we
can prove any record against a public Cardano anchor."

## 2. Concepts in two minutes

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Chain id** | Name of your app chain (`yano.app-chain.chain-id`), encoded as 1–128 valid UTF-8 bytes. One group = one chain id. A node can host several chains (section 8). |
| **Member** | A participant identified by an Ed25519 public key. Only members' messages are accepted; members co-sign blocks. The v1 profile supports at most 32 members. |
| **Sequencer / proposer** | The member that orders messages into blocks. It is either a configured fixed proposer or the deterministic member selected for the current L1-slot window in rotating mode. |
| **Threshold** | How many member signatures a finality certificate needs (e.g. 2 of 2). |
| **App message** | Envelope with an **opaque body** (your bytes — CBOR/JSON/protobuf/anything), signed by the sender. The framework never parses the body. |
| **Topic** | Optional sub-stream label inside a chain (routing/filtering). Names starting with `~` are reserved. |
| **App block** | Ordered batch of messages + post-state MPF root + finality certificate, hash-linked to the previous block. |
| **State root** | MPF (Aiken-compatible Merkle Patricia Forestry) root after applying a block. Identical on every member, anchorable to L1, provable. |
| **State machine** | The only component that interprets message bodies. Built-in: `ordered-log` + the standard library (section 9). Custom ones plug in (section 6). |
| **Anchor leader** | The one node with `anchor.enabled` — it drives L1 anchoring (builds/pays/submits anchor txs). A coordination + fee-paying role, orthogonal to the proposer and NOT a trust point (§5.1); it does not rotate. |

The app-chain status page (`/ui/app-chain/`) includes a bounded inspector for
messages in its live finalized stream. Selecting a row freezes that message in
the inspector while new events continue arriving. The inspector shows envelope
metadata and, when safe, a strict UTF-8 or formatted JSON view; otherwise it
shows bounded hexadecimal bytes. This is a technical view of the opaque
app-chain body, not a domain-document viewer. Documents referenced by a message
remain in their external system (for example object storage or IPFS); a domain
UI must retrieve and verify those bytes under its own authorization policy.

Trust model: **fail closed**. Envelope signatures, membership, vote
signatures, and certificate thresholds are cryptographically verified on every
node, always. A non-member's messages are dropped; a non-sequencer's blocks
are never finalized; a tampered block fails the state-root re-execution check.

For the full developer-level mechanics — the consensus round check by check,
vote locks, rotation math, catch-up/restart semantics, and every built-in
state machine's exact wire format — see the
[consensus & internals guide](core-host.md).

## 3. Quick start: generated project or two-node manual setup

This walkthrough uses `java -jar` with `-D` flags (built from source). The
**official distributions** work the same way — only where ordinary runtime
config lives differs:
the release zip (`yano-<ver>.zip`) has a `./yano.sh start:<profile>` launcher
plus `config/application.yml`; the Docker bundle (`yano-docker-<ver>.zip`)
mounts `config/application.yml` and a `plugins/` directory into the
`bloxbean/yano` image; native binaries mirror the zip layout (but cannot load
directory plugin JARs after build; manifested bundles may be included when the
native application is built). See the tutorial's Part 0 for per-distribution
instructions; releases: https://github.com/bloxbean/yano/releases

The public REST prefix is the exception: it is an immutable artifact input,
not a `-D` or YAML launch setting. Build it with `-PyanoApiPrefix` as described
in section 4 and the distribution guide.

### 3.0 Recommended: generate a release-pinned project

The distribution includes the separate app-chain developer tool behind
`yano.sh`; it does not start the node while generating or validating:

```bash
unzip yano-<version>.zip && cd yano-<version>
./yano.sh appchain recipes
./yano.sh appchain init --non-interactive \
  --recipe owned-registry --network preprod --members 3 \
  --deployment host --output product-registry
```

The user-owned source is `product-registry/appchain.yaml`. The initializer
materializes all consensus defaults, node overlays, schema/catalog snapshots,
secret-reference examples, an AI skill, CI checks, and `appchain.lock`. If
member public keys are not known yet, the lock records
`PUBLIC_MEMBER_IDENTITIES_REQUIRED_BEFORE_START`; add the three public keys to
the blueprint and regenerate:

```bash
./yano.sh appchain render product-registry
./yano.sh appchain config validate --mode project product-registry
./yano.sh appchain doctor product-registry --distribution .
```

Provision each node's private signer only in its untracked
`secrets/nodeN.env`, then copy the same validated project to the three
machines. Each operator starts only its node index with
`scripts/start-node N`; the shared consensus file and lock remain identical.

For Kubernetes delivery, derive reviewed output from the validated project:

```bash
./yano.sh appchain gitops product-registry \
  --target helm --output product-registry-helm
./yano.sh appchain gitops product-registry \
  --target kustomize --output product-registry-kustomize
```

The exporter creates Secret references, never Secret values, and writes a
`gitops.lock` binding the manifests to the blueprint, resolved configuration,
release catalog, and generated-file hashes. It does not apply manifests or
operate a cluster. Devnet is intentionally excluded because its current
launcher generates ephemeral genesis inputs.

The generated `.github/workflows/appchain-verify.yml` requires repository
variables `YANO_DISTRIBUTION_URL` and `YANO_DISTRIBUTION_SHA256`; it accepts
only the exact checksum-pinned HTTPS distribution. The same guarded
`configure-yano-appchain` skill is available under `skills/` in the release
and `ai/` in the project.

### 3.1 Generate member keys

Each member needs an Ed25519 keypair (32-byte seed). Using the built jar:

```bash
jshell --class-path app/build/yano.jar - <<'EOF'
import com.bloxbean.cardano.client.crypto.KeyGenUtil;
import com.bloxbean.cardano.yaci.core.util.HexUtil;
byte[] seed = new byte[32]; new java.security.SecureRandom().nextBytes(seed);
System.out.println("private (seed): " + HexUtil.encodeHexString(seed));
System.out.println("public        : " + HexUtil.encodeHexString(KeyGenUtil.getPublicKeyFromPrivateKey(seed)));
EOF
```

Run once per member (and once more for the anchor wallet if you enable
anchoring). Keep private seeds secret; collect all **public** keys into the
member list. **Keys are required, explicit configuration** — the node fails
fast at startup if its own public key is not in the member list.

### 3.2 Configure node A (the sequencer)

All settings live under `yano.app-chain.*` (application.yml or `-D` flags):

```yaml
yano:
  app-chain:
    enabled: true
    chain-id: "acme-audit-log"
    signing-key: "<node A private seed hex>"
    members: "<pubA>,<pubB>"
    peers: "nodeB.example.com:13337"        # other members' N2N server ports
    sequencer:
      proposer: "<pubA>"                    # node A sequences
    threshold: 2                            # 2-of-2 finality certs
    block:
      interval-ms: 2000
      max-messages: 500
```

### 3.3 Configure node B (a member)

Identical, except `signing-key` is B's seed and `peers` points at node A.
`sequencer.proposer` stays `<pubA>` on **every** node — it names who may
sequence, not who this node is.

### 3.4 Start and verify

Start both nodes as usual (any network role — devnet producer, relay,
preprod follower; the app chain is independent of the L1 role). Then:

```bash
curl -s http://nodeA:8080/api/v1/app-chain/status
# expect: "running": true, "sequencing": true, "role": "proposer",
#         "peers": {"nodeB...:13337": true}
```

Submit a message on either node and read it (finalized) from the other:

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://nodeA:8080/api/v1/app-chain/messages \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"topic":"orders","body":"order #1 created"}'
# → {"messageId":"6d1be691...","chainId":"acme-audit-log","topic":"orders"}

curl -s http://nodeB:8080/api/v1/app-chain/tip
# → {"chainId":"acme-audit-log","height":1,"stateRoot":"95edf7..."}  (same on A!)

curl -s http://nodeB:8080/api/v1/app-chain/state/proof/6d1be691...
# → MPF inclusion proof for the message against the shared state root
```

Ready-made end-to-end regressions of this flow (on devnet, with anchoring) are
the `test-app-chain-cluster` and `test-app-chain-extensions` skills under
`.claude/skills/`.

> **Devnet tip:** when node B follows a devnet producer for L1, start B with
> `-Dyano.dev-mode=false -Dyano.block-producer.enabled=false` and give it a
> copy of A's shelley genesis taken **after** A started (A rewrites
> `systemStart` into the file it loads).

### 3.5 Or: the one-command demo cluster

The distribution zips ship a ready-made multi-node launcher under
`appchain-cluster/` — the fastest way to evaluate everything in this guide
without writing any config:

```bash
unzip yano-<version>.zip && cd yano-<version>
./yano.sh appchain cluster start 3          # 3-node devnet: L1 producer + 2 followers,
                                             # 2 demo chains (ordered-log + kv-registry)
./yano.sh appchain cluster status           # tips + state-root agreement across nodes
./yano.sh appchain cluster submit orders-chain demo "hello"
./yano.sh appchain cluster kv registry-chain set color blue
./appchain-cluster/loadtest.sh orders-chain -n 2000 -c 20     # throughput test
./appchain-cluster/loadtest.sh registry-chain --kv -n 2000    # kv chains need --kv
./yano.sh appchain cluster clean            # stop + wipe
```

Highlights (full reference: `appchain-cluster/README.md`):

- **Anchoring demo**: `start 3 --anchor` (script mode) then
  `anchor-bootstrap orders-chain` — funds via the devnet faucet and mints the
  thread NFT. `--anchor-mode metadata` is the simplest possible anchoring.
- **Public networks**: `start 3 --network preprod --anchor-mode script
  --anchor-key $(openssl rand -hex 32)` — every node relays preprod, and you
  fund the printed wallet address yourself (§5.1). The launcher refuses the
  built-in demo anchor key on public networks (it is publicly known).
- Chains come from `config/application-appchain.yml` — add/remove chains
  there and the launcher auto-discovers them; it injects the per-node keys,
  members, threshold and peers, so the same file runs at any cluster size.
- Works against the jar or the native binary (auto-detected), and from a
  source checkout (`scripts/appchain-cluster/`) or any unzipped release tree.

## 4. REST API

Base path: `<artifact-api-prefix>/app-chain` (default
`/api/v1/app-chain`). The prefix is fixed into each JVM/native/container
artifact with strict `-PyanoApiPrefix=<path>`; it is not editable launch
configuration. `/` and canonical paths up to 256 characters are supported.
Changing it requires a rebuild; see
[`BUILD_DISTRIBUTIONS.md`](BUILD_DISTRIBUTIONS.md#artifact-api-prefix).

Every chain endpoint below is also available **chain-scoped** as
`/app-chain/chains/{chainId}/...` on a multi-chain node (section 8). The
chain-less form keeps working while exactly one chain is configured; with
several chains it returns `400` (ambiguous), and `503` when no chain is
enabled. When API-key auth is on (section 12), every request needs `X-API-Key`.

**Swagger UI** (`/q/swagger-ui/`) documents the chain-scoped surface only —
the chain-less aliases are deliberately hidden from the OpenAPI document
(they can only answer 400 on a multi-chain node). Prefer the
`chains/{chainId}` paths in new integrations; the chain-less forms remain as
a single-chain convenience.

| Method & path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /chains` | Hosted chains: `[{chainId, tipHeight, stateRoot}]`. |
| `POST /messages` | Submit a message. Body: `{"topic": "...", "body": "<text>"}` or `{"topic": "...", "bodyHex": "<hex bytes>"}`. Returns `202` with the content-derived `messageId`. |
| `GET /messages?limit=100&topic=...` | Recently accepted messages (local + peer), with sender, sequence, body hex, source. |
| `GET /messages/{messageIdHex}` | One finalized message: position (`height`, `index`) + full content (§15). |
| `GET /messages/by-topic/{topic}?fromHeight=&limit=` | Finalized message refs on a topic, ascending (§15). |
| `GET /messages/by-sender/{senderHex}?fromHeight=&limit=` | Finalized message refs from a member key, ascending (§15). |
| `GET /status` | Chain status: role, tip height, state root, pool size, peer connectivity, counters, anchor + sink progress. |
| `GET /tip` | `{chainId, height, stateRoot}` of the last finalized block. |
| `GET /blocks/{height}` | Finalized block: hashes, roots, proposer, cert signature count, full message list. |
| `GET /blocks?from=&limit=` | Paged block summaries, ascending (default: window ending at the tip) (§15). |
| `GET /state/proof/{keyHex}` | MPF inclusion proof (wire format) for a state key against the committed root. For `ordered-log` the key **is** the message id; the response includes the value and `finalizedAtHeight`. |
| `GET /evidence/{messageIdHex}` | Portable, offline-verifiable evidence bundle for a finalized message (§13). |
| `GET /stream?fromHeight=&topic=` | SSE stream of finalized messages: replay, then live (§10). |
| `POST /snapshot` | Atomic ledger snapshot for fast member onboarding (§14). Body: `{"path": "<fresh dir>"}`. |
| `POST /admin/pause` / `POST /admin/resume` | Pause/resume local submissions (§14). |
| `POST /admin/drain-pool` | Drop all pending (unfinalized) messages (§14). |
| `POST /admin/force-anchor` | Anchor the current tip now (§14). |
| `GET /admin/members` | Effective member set + threshold (§14). |
| `POST /admin/members/add` / `.../remove` | Stage a member key in/out for rotation (§14). Body: `{"publicKey": "..."}`. |
| `POST /admin/members/reset` | Drop the persisted member override; back to the configured list (§14). |
| `POST /admin/threshold` | Set the finality threshold (§14). Body: `{"threshold": N}`. |

Submission notes:
- The node signs your submission with **its own** member key (the REST caller
  is trusted local input — same model as a wallet talking to its own node).
- The body is opaque: `body` (UTF-8 text) or `bodyHex` (arbitrary bytes).
- Limits: `max-message-bytes` (default 64 KB), TTL `default-ttl-seconds`
  (default 600) — an unfinalized message expires out of the pool after that.
- Topics starting with `~` are reserved (consensus/system traffic).
- **Backpressure**: when the pending pool (`pool.max-messages`, default
  10 000) is full, `POST /messages` returns **429** and the message is
  neither stored nor relayed — back off and retry. Inbound gossip dropped by
  a full pool is counted in `GET /status` under `drops.pool_full`
  (never an error: the sender's own node already holds the message).
- **Replay protection (sender-seq)**: every envelope carries a per-sender
  sequence number. A message whose seq is at or below the sender's last
  *finalized* seq is a replay — rejected at admission on every ledger node
  (counted as `drops.stale_seq`). Gaps are allowed and meaningless (seqs are
  wall-clock-seeded so restarts never reuse one); the seq does **not** define
  ordering — the sequencer does. With `message.enforce-sender-seq: true`
  the rule also becomes consensus-visible: followers reject any block whose
  per-sender seqs are not strictly increasing above the finalized floor
  (default off this release for compatibility; all members must agree on
  this flag, like the state machine id).

## 5. L1 anchoring

Anchoring periodically commits the app chain's position — height, block hash
and **state root** — onto Cardano, through the node's own mempool and tx
diffusion, confirmed by the node's own L1 sync. Two modes
(`anchor.mode: metadata | script`):

| | `metadata` (default) | `script` (ADR 008.4) |
|---|---|---|
| Anchor tx | plain tx, anchor payload in tx metadata | Plutus V3 **thread-NFT** UTxO; a validator enforces the datum chain on-chain |
| What L1 enforces | nothing (data-only commitment) | monotonic height, stable chain-id, **m-of-n member signatures** on every advance |
| Signing | anchor wallet only | wallet + threshold co-signed member witnesses |
| Setup | fund the wallet — done | fund + one-time `admin/anchor/bootstrap` per chain |
| Cost | ~0.17–0.2 ADA per anchor | ~0.35 ADA per anchor (script execution) |

Both modes work on the devnet and on public networks (script anchors are
proven on preprod: real Plutus V3 mint + validator-enforced co-signed
advances).

### 5.1 The anchor wallet (both modes)

The anchor wallet is a raw **32-byte Ed25519 seed** (`anchor.signing-key`,
hex); the node derives its **enterprise address** and logs it at startup
(`anchor wallet address: addr...`) — it is also in `/status` under
`anchor.walletAddress`. **Fund that address**; on devnet use
`POST /api/v1/devnet/fund {"address": "...", "ada": 100}`, on a testnet the
[official faucet](https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-testnets/tools/faucet)
can send straight to it.

- A CIP-1852 wallet mnemonic (Eternl/Lace/devkit) can **not** be converted
  into this seed — HD payment keys are extended keys, not seeds. Generate a
  dedicated seed (`openssl rand -hex 32`) and fund its address instead. This
  is good ops hygiene anyway: the key sits in plain config on the node box,
  so treat it as a hot wallet holding fee money only.
- Only the anchor **leader** needs `anchor.*` config (typically node 0 / the
  sequencer host). Script-mode members co-sign and adopt the on-chain
  identity with **zero anchor config** — they verify each advance against
  their own ledger and L1 view before signing.

**The anchor leader role, precisely.** The leader is the node that DRIVES
anchoring: it watches finalized progress, builds the anchor tx when
`every-blocks` accumulate, pays fees/collateral from the anchor wallet,
submits through the node's own tx path and tracks L1 confirmation. It is a
different axis from the sequencer/proposer (which orders app blocks and MAY
rotate) — anchor leadership is fixed to the `anchor.enabled` node and does
not rotate, because there is exactly one thread UTxO to spend and one wallet
paying fees (concurrent leaders would merely race on the same UTxO).

It is **not a trust point** in script mode: every advance needs `threshold`
member co-signatures, each member verifies the proposed range against its
OWN ledger and L1 view before signing, and the on-chain validator re-enforces
the member threshold and monotonic height independently. The worst a dead or
compromised leader can do is *stop anchoring* — a liveness issue, never a
safety one: the app chain keeps finalizing and `lagBlocks` climbs visibly.
Recovery is operational: enable `anchor.*` (with the wallet key) on another
member and restart it — the on-chain identity is persisted on L1 and members
adopt it from sign requests, so the new leader resumes where the old one
stopped. (Metadata mode is the same minus co-signing; its commitment is
data-only, so the leader alone signs — the trust statement is accordingly
weaker.)

### 5.2 Metadata anchors

```yaml
yano:
  app-chain:
    anchor:
      enabled: true
      mode: metadata                                    # default
      signing-key: "<anchor wallet Ed25519 seed hex>"   # separate from member keys
      every-blocks: 10                                  # anchor cadence
      max-interval-minutes: 60
      metadata-label: 7014
    l1:
      stability-depth: 36        # L1 depth of the l1-ref carried in app blocks
```

Commits `[chain-id, from-height, to-height, block-hash, state-root]` as tx
metadata (label `7014` by default). Anchors start automatically once the
wallet holds funds. Unconfirmed anchors are resubmitted; an L1 rollback that
undoes an anchor puts it back in pending automatically.

### 5.3 Script anchors (thread NFT + on-chain validator)

```yaml
yano:
  app-chain:
    anchor:
      enabled: true
      mode: script
      signing-key: "<anchor wallet Ed25519 seed hex>"
      every-blocks: 30
      # script.validator / script.thread-policy default to the bundled julc
      # artifacts; an Aiken twin ships in-repo (same ABI, interchangeable):
      #   script:
      #     validator: file:/path/to/anchor-validator.plutus.json
      #     thread-policy: file:/path/to/thread-policy.plutus.json
    l1:
      stability-depth: 36
```

One-time **bootstrap** per chain (leader only, wallet must be funded):

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:7070/api/v1/app-chain/chains/<chain-id>/admin/anchor/bootstrap
```

The bootstrap consumes a seed UTxO from the wallet and mints a **one-shot
thread NFT** into the anchor validator's script address with the genesis
datum at app height `0`. This transaction establishes identity only; it does
not unilaterally certify the current app tip. On a non-empty chain the leader
immediately starts the normal threshold-co-sign round for the first real
advance, without waiting for another user transaction or the configured
anchor cadence. That mint defines the chain's permanent on-chain identity:

- **thread policy id** — unique per chain (derived from the consumed seed
  UTxO; can never be minted again). Burning is forbidden by the policy.
- **script address** — the validator is parameterized by the policy id, so
  every chain gets its own address.
- The NFT's **asset name is the first 32 bytes of the chain-id's UTF-8
  encoding** (the whole id when it fits), giving explorers a useful label.
  The full chain id remains in the datum. Identity and uniqueness come from
  the policy id, never the name.

From then on the leader runs threshold **co-sign rounds**: it builds the
advance tx (spending the thread UTxO, writing the next datum), members verify
the proposed range against their OWN ledger + L1 view and return Ed25519
witnesses, and at `threshold` signatures the tx is submitted. The on-chain
validator independently enforces: exactly one continuing thread output,
the exact v1 datum profile on both input and successor (seven fields,
version 1, bounded chain id, non-negative height, 32-byte commitments,
1--32 sorted unique member keys, and a valid threshold), monotonic height,
unchanged chain-id, ≥ threshold signatures of the datum's member set, and no
value drain. Membership changes (§14.2) flow into the datum, so the on-chain
member set tracks the chain's governance.

Watch progress in `/status` under `anchor` (`bootstrapped`, `threadPolicyId`,
`scriptAddress`, `walletAddress`, `cosignPending`, `lastAnchorTx`,
`lagBlocks`), or on the `/ui/app-chain/` page's L1 Anchor card. Anchors fire
when at least one NEW block exists and `every-blocks` accumulated since the
last anchor (or `max-interval-minutes` elapsed). The first real advance after
bootstrap is immediate when the app tip is non-zero; an app chain that has
never produced a block remains at height `0` and has nothing to anchor.

Every script-anchor member independently reconciles `lastAnchoredHeight`,
`lastAnchorTx`, `lastAnchorL1Slot` and `lagBlocks` from the authenticated
thread UTxO in its own L1 view.  These durable fields should converge across
members.  The page's “Anchors Confirmed/Observed (since restart)” value is a
node-local operational counter and may differ after restarts.

The reconciliation read is accepted only when the UTxO store's committed
slot and block hash exactly match the node's canonical L1 point.  A follower
also keeps a first-seen script identity non-authoritative until an exact
advance transaction that it verified is accepted by the on-chain threshold;
a single member's sign request cannot by itself open evidence or effect gates.

### 5.4 Independent verification (auditors, third parties)

The design goal: **prove a record's inclusion without trusting any Yano
node.** What lives on L1 (readable from any Cardano source — an explorer,
Koios, db-sync, your own node): the thread UTxO's inline datum with
`(version, chain-id, height, block-hash, state-root, member-keys,
threshold)`, and the validator-enforced chain of every advance back to the
one-shot mint.

**Any message (e.g. an order on an ordered-log chain):**

1. `GET /api/v1/app-chain/chains/{chainId}/evidence/{messageIdHex}` — portable
   **evidence material**: the message's block, every block up to the next
   anchored one, finality-cert signatures, claimed member set, and anchor ref.
   A portable segment carries at most 4,096 blocks and at most one configured
   block-byte budget (with a 16 MiB absolute ceiling). If reaching the current
   anchor would exceed either bound, the response intentionally contains only
   the finalized message block and no anchor reference; obtain an archived
   bundle or a future range proof rather than treating the missing reference
   as failed finality.
2. Obtain the expected chain id, member keys, and threshold independently from
   the trusted chain profile or the exact Cardano anchor datum. Verify with
   `EvidenceVerifier.verify(bundle, trustContext)` from `yano-core-api`. It
   checks message-id inclusion via the recomputed messages-root, the prev-hash
   chain, the independently pinned m-of-n signatures, and the claimed anchor
   block hash. Never derive the trust context only from the bundle.
3. Close the loop on L1: fetch the transaction and outputs, require the expected
   script address and state-thread token, decode the canonical inline datum,
   and match its chain id, height, block hash, state root, member set, and
   threshold. Transaction-hash visibility alone is not anchor verification.

Finality signs the block header, whose messages-root commits ordered message
ids. It does not independently authenticate every serialized message-envelope
field or the stored proposer field. After body pruning, evidence still proves
the retained message id was included but reports that original content was not
verified.

**Any state entry (e.g. a kv-registry key) against the anchored root:**

`GET /api/v1/app-chain/chains/{chainId}/state/proof/{keyHex}` returns an **MPF
inclusion proof** verifiable against the `state-root` in the L1 datum with
any independent MPF implementation (the `vds-mpf` Java library or Aiken's
`merkle-patricia-forestry` — same construction, so on-chain verification in
a validator is also possible). Add `?height={anchoredHeight}` to request a
proof against that exact retained historical post-state root.

The console's portable-verification card can load the latest anchored proof
and verify it with the release-matched bounded verifier. The equivalent
read-class API calls are:

```text
GET  /api/v1/app-chain/chains/{chainId}/anchor/commitment
GET  /api/v1/app-chain/chains/{chainId}/state/proof/{keyHex}?height={height}
POST /api/v1/app-chain/chains/{chainId}/proof/verify
```

The verification request contains `mode` (`inclusion` or `exclusion`),
`expectedRootHex`, `keyHex`, optional inclusion `valueHex`, and
`proofWireHex`. Keys are limited to 256 bytes; values and proof wires are
limited to 1 MiB each. All hex is canonical lowercase. The result establishes
the MPF relationship to the supplied root only. The anchor projection is
explicitly **L1-confirmed by this node**; independently resolve and validate
the shown Cardano transaction before treating its root as an external trust
anchor.

The generic console groups this work under **Proofs**, with separate
**Message**, **State**, **Import and verify**, and **Advanced** workflows.
Typed state subjects are discovered from the immutable capability manifest;
plugins contribute closed data descriptors rather than executable UI code.
See the [Proof Lab guide](appchain/PROOF_LAB.md) for operator,
application-author, plugin-author, independent-verifier, and Cardano-validator
procedures, including the default finalized block-message-root index and the
MPF/JMT trust boundary.

### 5.5 L1 observations (reacting to L1 events)

The reverse direction — the app chain consuming L1 facts — is handled by
**observers** (ADR 008.4 §3): each member watches its own L1 view, and an
observed fact is injected as a framework message on the reserved
`~l1/<observer-id>` topic only after it is `l1.stability-depth` blocks deep.
Followers re-derive the claim from their OWN L1 stream before accepting it,
so a compromised proposer cannot fabricate L1 facts.

```yaml
yano:
  app-chain:
    l1:
      stability-depth: 36          # observers REQUIRE stability-depth > 0
    observation:
      # SHA-256 of the exact Shelley genesis file for this L1 network.
      # Required when any block or epoch observer is configured.
      l1-network-genesis-id: "0123456789abcdef...64 lowercase hex characters"
    observers:
      deposits:
        type: address-deposit      # built-in: watch an address for deposits
        address: "addr_test1..."
      papers:
        type: metadata-label       # built-in: watch a tx metadata label
        label: "20250712"
```

Observer config and `observation.l1-network-genesis-id` must be **identical on
every member** (they are consensus-critical). The genesis id is a 32-byte
network identity encoded as 64 lowercase hex characters; use the SHA-256 of
the exact Shelley genesis file shared by the members. It prevents otherwise
identical observer profiles on different L1 networks from sharing an app-chain
consensus identity. Startup fails when an observer is configured without it.

Custom block observers implement `L1ObserverProvider`; custom epoch observers
implement `L1EpochObserverProvider` (ServiceLoader, same plugin pattern as
state machines). Every custom provider must override
`consensusIdentity(observerId, settings)` and return an
`L1ObserverConsensusIdentity` containing:

- a positive observer ABI version;
- the canonical claim schema identifier;
- a positive canonical ordering version; and
- deterministic, unambiguous identity bytes for every setting that can change
  emitted claims or their order.

Normalize and length-delimit variable fields. Do not include credentials,
URLs, paths, retry limits, timeouts, or other operational settings that cannot
change deterministic observation output. The default SPI method deliberately
throws, so a custom provider cannot start until it declares this contract.

Read observations like any messages:
`GET .../messages/by-topic/~l1%2Fdeposits`.

---

## 6. Custom app chains (your own state machine)

The framework never interprets message bodies — a **state machine** does.
Before writing one, check the standard library (section 9): registry,
approvals, balances and document-trail machines ship in the distribution. The
separate packaged role-workflow bundle supplies generic `role-approvals` for
non-member business actors. The evidence-profile bundle supplies the complete
`role-evidence` preset; see
[Domain Actors and Role-Aware Approvals](APP_CHAIN_DOMAIN_ROLES.md).
For everything else, implement
`org.yanoproject.api.appchain.AppStateMachine`:

```java
public class OrderBookStateMachine implements AppStateMachine {
    @Override
    public String id() { return "order-book"; }

    @Override
    public AdmissionResult validate(AppMessage message) {
        // fast, side-effect-free mempool admission (body is your format)
        return AdmissionResult.accept();
    }

    @Override
    public void apply(AppBlock block, AppStateWriter writer) {
        // deterministic! called once per finalized block, in order, on every node.
        // everything written here is committed atomically with the block and
        // becomes part of the MPF state root.
        for (AppMessage m : block.messages()) {
            MyOrder order = decode(m.getBody());          // your codec
            writer.put(order.idBytes(), order.toBytes());
        }
    }
}
```

Rules: `apply` must be **deterministic** — every member re-executes it and
the resulting state root must match the proposer's byte-for-byte, or the block
is rejected (and your chain stalls at that height). Forbidden inside
`apply()`: wall-clock time (use `block.timestamp()`), randomness, network or
file I/O, environment reads, iteration over unordered collections
(`HashMap`/`HashSet` — use ordered ones), and locale/charset-dependent or
library-default serialization. Note that `validate()` runs at the proposer's
admission only — any rule that must hold by consensus belongs in `apply()`.

**Verify before deploying** with the conformance harness (in `yano-runtime`,
ADR 008.1 I1.6) — it applies one identical block corpus through the real
ledger commit path in N independent runs plus a kill-and-reopen replay, and
asserts byte-identical roots at every height:

```java
StateMachineConformance.builder(new MyStateMachineProvider())
        .blocks(50).messagesPerBlock(5).seed(42)
        .bodyGenerator((height, index, random) -> myRealisticCommand(random))
        .assertDeterministic();   // AssertionError with the exact divergence height
```

The plugin template ships this test pre-wired (`CounterConformanceTest`).

### 6.1 Deploy as a plugin jar on the default distribution (no rebuild)

1. Implement `AppStateMachineProvider`:
   ```java
   public class OrderBookProvider implements AppStateMachineProvider {
       public String id() { return "order-book"; }
       public AppStateMachine create() { return new OrderBookStateMachine(); }
   }
   ```
2. Add the ServiceLoader entry to your jar:
   `META-INF/services/org.yanoproject.api.appchain.AppStateMachineProvider`
   containing the provider class name.
3. Add the bundle manifest
   `META-INF/yano/plugins/<bundle-id>.json`; its contribution kind, name and
   provider class must exactly match the ServiceLoader entry. Package any
   non-host runtime dependencies into the same reproducible bundle JAR; do not
   deploy adjacent thin dependency JARs as one catalog-v1 bundle.
4. For schema-aware tooling, add the data-only descriptor
   `META-INF/yano/appchain-config-metadata-v1.json`. For distribution or CI
   trust, sign the descriptor and exact runtime manifest in
   `META-INF/yano/appchain-config-metadata-v1.sig.json`, then verify with an
   operator-pinned raw Ed25519 public key:
   ```bash
   ./yano.sh appchain metadata verify plugins/order-book.jar \
     --trust-key vendor-release-2026=<64-hex-public-key>
   ```
   Verification authenticates publisher identity and the byte binding only.
   It does not load the plugin or raise third-party metadata above `PARTIAL`
   validation coverage. The envelope schema and canonical payload contract are
   packaged as `appchain-metadata-trust.schema.json` and documented by the
   app-chain developer tool.
5. Drop the jar into the JVM node's plugins directory (`yano.plugins.directory`,
   default `plugins/`), and select it:
   ```yaml
   yano:
     app-chain:
       state-machine: "order-book"
   ```
   Unknown ids fail fast at startup with the list of available machines.
   Compile against the `yano-core-api` artifact (`AppStateMachine`,
   `AppMessage`, `AppStateWriter` live there / in `yaci-core`).
   A ready Gradle project for this is `scaffolds/plugin-template`.

ServiceLoader-only legacy providers remain a temporary compatibility path for
self-contained JARs loaded from the JVM plugin directory (and for explicit
library compatibility mode). Packaged JVM inclusion requires the bundle
manifest: strict index generation cannot safely assign an unmanifested
provider's external dependencies to a bundle closure and tells the developer
to add a manifest or use the JVM directory bundle. Yano X does not publish
native extension bundles.

### 6.2 Embed programmatically (library mode)

For fully custom nodes, `AppChainSubsystem` (module `runtime`,
`org.yanoproject.runtime.appchain`) is a public kernel `Subsystem`
whose constructor accepts your `AppStateMachine` instance directly. A
first-class `YanoAssembly.appChain(spec)` builder is planned; until then the
plugin-jar route is the recommended packaging for custom chains.

## 7. Configuration reference

Flat (single-chain) keys. The same suffixes apply per chain under
`yano.app-chain.chains[i].` (section 8):

| Property (`yano.app-chain.`) | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | — | See "Enabling" below |
| `chain-id` | — | App-chain identity (required; 1–128 valid UTF-8 bytes, no NUL) |
| `signing-key` | — | This member's Ed25519 private seed, hex, or a `scheme:reference` external-signer spec (§12) |
| `members` | — | Comma-separated member public keys, hex (required; must include own key; at most 32 in v1) |
| `peers` | — | Comma-separated app-group peers `host:port` (their N2N server ports) |
| `sequencer.proposer` | empty | Fixed sequencer's public key (implies `sequencer.mode: fixed`). No proposer AND no mode = diffusion-only (messages replicate, but no blocks/ledger) |
| `sequencer.mode` | `fixed` | Consensus mode: `fixed` (ADR-005 S1), `rotating` (S2 — proposership rotates over L1-slot windows; needs no fixed proposer), or a plugin `SequencerModeProvider` id. **Must match on all members.** Finality (threshold certs, one-vote-per-height) is identical in every mode |
| `sequencer.window-slots` | `60` | `rotating` only: L1 slots per proposer window. Rotating mode requires an L1 feed and prefers thresholds like 2-of-3 over all-of-n (see the rotation runbook in ADR 008.2) |
| `threshold` | `1` | Finality certificate signatures required |
| `membership.mode` | `static` | `governed` = membership changes are finalized chain transactions requiring threshold-many identical member commands (§14.2, ADR 008.3). **Must match on all members** |
| `membership.approval-window-blocks` | `600` | `governed` only: blocks a half-approved command stays pending before expiring |
| `transport.mode` | `shared` | Outbound app transport (node-global). `shared`: when the L1 upstream is also an app-group peer, protocols 100/103 ride its session — one TCP connection per peer pair, with an automatic dedicated-dial fallback if the session stays down (~15s grace). `dedicated`: always dial a separate app connection (bandwidth isolation from L1 sync). Peers that are not the upstream always use dedicated dials; inbound is unaffected (the server port multiplexes both since v1). Per-peer transport is visible in `status` under `peerTransports` |
| `block.interval-ms` | `2000` | Proposer tick (blocks are only made when messages are pending) |
| `block.max-bytes` | `4194304` (4 MiB) | Primary finalized-block-size cap (v1 maximum 16 MiB). The proposer reserves the framework's worst-case 32-member finality-certificate headroom before selecting messages; members reject oversized proposals and finalized blocks. Must exceed `max-message-bytes` by the pinned envelope/certificate headroom. Tune for throughput |
| `block.max-messages` | `5000` | Safety backstop against tiny-message floods (v1 maximum 10,000; the byte cap above is primary) |
| `state-machine` | `ordered-log` | Built-in id, a stdlib id (§9) or a plugin provider id |
| `max-message-bytes` | `65536` | Max opaque body size (v1 maximum = 16 MiB minus the pinned block-envelope and worst-case certificate headroom) |
| `max-ttl-seconds` | `3600` | Max accepted message TTL |
| `default-ttl-seconds` | `600` | TTL applied to REST submissions |
| `anchor.enabled` | `false` | L1 anchoring on this node (the anchor leader; script-mode members need NO anchor config) |
| `anchor.mode` | `metadata` | `metadata` (data-only tx) or `script` (thread-NFT + on-chain validator, §5.3) |
| `anchor.signing-key` | — | Anchor wallet seed, hex, 32 bytes (required if anchoring; §5.1) |
| `anchor.every-blocks` | `10` | Anchor after this many new app blocks |
| `anchor.max-interval-minutes` | `60` | Anchor at least this often while blocks pend |
| `anchor.metadata-label` | `7014` | Metadata label of anchor txs (metadata mode) |
| `anchor.script.validator` | `builtin:aiken` | Script mode: anchor validator artifact — `builtin:aiken`, `file:/path` (blueprint or raw hex) or `hex:...` |
| `anchor.script.thread-policy` | `builtin:aiken` | Script mode: thread-policy artifact (same forms) |
| `observers.<id>.type` | — | L1 observer instance (§5.5): `address-deposit`, `metadata-label`, or a plugin provider id. Further `observers.<id>.*` keys are provider settings (e.g. `address`, `label`). Must be identical on all members; requires `l1.stability-depth > 0` |
| `observation.l1-network-genesis-id` | — | Required when any block or epoch observer is configured: 32-byte L1 network genesis identity as 64 lowercase hex characters. Use the SHA-256 of the exact Shelley genesis file and configure the same value on every member (§5.5) |
| `anchor.validity-slots` | `7200` | Anchor tx TTL = current L1 slot + this; a resubmitted anchor can never race a late-landing original |
| `anchor.fallback-fee-lovelace` | `300000` | Anchor tx fee when protocol parameters are unavailable; normally the fee is computed from the node's current params by tx size |
| `l1.stability-depth` | `0` | Depth of the stable L1 reference in app blocks (0 = off). When > 0, followers verify each proposal's L1 ref against their **own** L1 view (monotonic, hash-matched at depth; brief proposer lead is retried, a fabricated ref is rejected fail-closed) and the node refuses to start without an L1 event feed |
| `pool.max-messages` | `10000` | Pending-pool capacity; a full pool returns 429 on submit and drops (counted) inbound gossip (§4) |
| `message.enforce-sender-seq` | `false` | Consensus-visible sender-seq rule: followers reject blocks with stale/duplicate per-sender seqs (§4). Must match on all members |
| `effects.enabled` | `false` | Enable the effect system (§18). **Consensus-affecting — must match on all members**; also all `effects.*` caps and gate/commitment keys below |
| `effects.max-per-block` / `max-payload-bytes` / `max-expiry-blocks` / `result-window-blocks` | `256` / `16384` / `100000` / `100000` | Deterministic emission caps and result-incorporation window (§18.1); payload bytes are capped at 16 MiB—use payload-by-hash for larger bodies |
| `effects.default-gate` | `app-final` | `app-final` \| `l1-anchored` \| `zk-settled` — when emitted effects become executable (§18.4) |
| `effects.outcome-commitment` | `per-effect` | `per-effect` (O(1) proofs) \| `per-block` (trie growth O(effectful blocks); ZK-friendly) |
| `effects.strict-reserved-prefix` | `true` | Reject app writes to the `~fx/` trie prefix (consensus-affecting; active even when effects are off) |
| `effects.result.signers` | empty | Restrict who may attest `~fx/result` to these member keys (default: any member; §18.5) |
| `effects.executor.enabled` | `false` | This node RUNS effects (execution plane, §18.3). Node-local — not consensus. When explicitly enabled, invalid settings, missing executors or runtime initialization failure make startup fail; the node never silently drops this role |
| `effects.executor.types` / `tick-ms` / `max-parallel` / `max-attempts` / `backoff-initial-ms` / `backoff-max-ms` | ` ` / `2000` / `4` / `8` / `2000` / `300000` | Executor tuning (§18.3) |
| `effects.executor.identity` | generated node-local sidecar | Stable identity for this node's disposable execution progress. The generated file lives beside the checkpointed chain directory, so member-key rotation preserves work but restoring onto another executor resets/quarantines it. Set an explicit unique value when storage is relocated; never clone it across physical executors (§18.3) |
| `effects.external.enabled` | `false` | Expose the external-executor claim/report REST surface (§18.6) |
| `effects.executors.<scheme>.*` | — | Executor plugin config (built-in `webhook`; `cardano` via the plugin jar) — passed to the executor with the prefix stripped (§18.3) |
| `effects.retention.keep-blocks` | `100000` | Prune resolved effect records older than this behind the tip |
| `machines.approvals.on-approved-effect.enabled` (+ `type` / `gate` / `expiry-blocks`) | `false` | Emit one generic CHAIN-result effect after final approval (§18.3); also requires `machines.approvals.activations.on-approved-effect=<height>` |

**Enabling.** Three states, checked in this order:

- An **explicit** `yano.app-chain.enabled: false` always wins: it suppresses
  the app chain entirely, including `chains[i]` auto-enable (operator kill
  switch). Leave the key **absent** unless you mean this.
- Any `chains[i].*` configuration present → the app chain **auto-enables**;
  no `enabled` key needed (section 8).
- Flat keys + `enabled: true` → one chain. This is the classic single-chain
  config and remains fully supported.

Extension settings are documented next to the capability they configure:
`chains[i].*` (§8), `webhooks` and `sinks.*` (§10), `api.auth.enabled` and
`api.keys` (§12), `retention.*` (§13), `zk.*` (§17), `effects.*` (§18).

App-chain state has its own node-local storage root:

```yaml
yano:
  app-chain:
    storage:
      path: appchain-chainstate  # default
```

An absolute value is used as-is. A relative value uses the process working
directory, like `yano.storage.path`. With the usual working directory and L1
state at `./chainstate`, the default produces `./appchain-chainstate`. Multi-node
launchers must assign a distinct app-chain storage path to every node.

Rebuildable app-chain read indexes use a third node-local root:

```yaml
yano:
  app-chain:
    indexer:
      storage:
        path: appchain-indexers  # default
```

Never restore this derived index root as part of either authoritative
chainstate. It can be deleted and rebuilt from finalized app-chain blocks.

Current v1 `effects.*` consensus settings—including `result.signers`, caps,
commitment mode and root/record algorithms—are immutable after chain launch.
Machine activation is implemented, but framework-level effect-setting epochs
from ADR-010.1 D5 are still pending; changing these values on an existing
history can make replay diverge.

Storage: each app ledger is a separate RocksDB at
`<resolved yano.app-chain.storage.path>/<chain-id>/` — blocks, state trie,
indexes and anchor markers commit atomically and are independent of the L1
chain state.
Back it up like any RocksDB directory (node stopped), or use snapshots (§14).
The app chain is append-only after finality; there is no rollback path.

Events (for `@DomainEventListener` plugins): `AppMessageReceivedEvent`,
`AppBlockFinalizedEvent`, `AppChainAnchoredEvent`, `AppChainStalledEvent`.

## 8. Multiple chains per node

One Yano node can host several independent app chains — each with its own
ledger, state machine, member set, sequencer and anchor policy — sharing the
node's networking and L1 view. Configuration is the same set of keys, indexed:

```yaml
yano:
  app-chain:
    chains[0]:
      chain-id: "orders-chain"
      signing-key: "<seed hex>"
      members: "<pubA>,<pubB>"
      peers: "nodeB.example.com:13337"
      sequencer:
        proposer: "<pubA>"
      threshold: 2
      anchor:
        enabled: true
        signing-key: "<anchor seed hex>"
    chains[1]:
      chain-id: "audit-chain"
      state-machine: kv-registry
      signing-key: "<seed hex>"
      members: "<pubA>,<pubB>"
      peers: "nodeB.example.com:13337"
      sequencer:
        proposer: "<pubA>"
      threshold: 2
```

- Every per-chain key uses the same suffixes as the flat config — including
  `anchor.*`, `webhooks`, `retention.*`, `sinks.*` and `zk.*`. Anchor only
  the chains that need L1 evidence.
- Chains are indexed from 0; `chain-id` is required per entry. Presence of
  any `chains[i]` config auto-enables the app chain (section 7).
- REST: `GET /app-chain/chains` lists hosted chains; address one with
  `/app-chain/chains/{chainId}/...`. The chain-less paths keep working when
  exactly one chain is configured; with several they return `400`.
- Each chain stores its ledger under
  `<resolved yano.app-chain.storage.path>/<chain-id>/`.

## 9. Standard-library state machines

`yano-x-stdlib` ships in the default distribution and is inert until a
machine is selected by id — `yano.app-chain.state-machine` (or per chain,
`chains[i].state-machine`). CBOR command formats and client-side command
encoders are documented on the classes in `state-machines/stdlib` and,
field by field, in the
[consensus & internals guide §10](core-host.md). All
machines keep the framework guarantees: deterministic apply, provable state
keys, anchorable roots. All members of a chain must run the same machine id.

**`ordered-log`** (default) — the tamper-evident ordered log of opaque blobs
described in section 1. No configuration needed.

**`kv-registry`** — a replicated registry with **per-key ownership**: the
first writer of a key becomes its owner (owner = the authenticated envelope
sender), and only the owner may update or delete it. Every entry is a provable
`[owner, value]` pair. Use for token registries, DID documents, allow-lists,
shared configuration.

```yaml
yano.app-chain.state-machine: kv-registry
# Optional structural check on PUT values (raw | cbor | utf8, default raw).
# A non-conforming PUT is rejected at admission and is a deterministic no-op
# in apply on every member.
yano.app-chain.machines.kv-registry.value-format: cbor
```

**`approvals`** — k-of-n approval workflows: `propose` / `approve` / `reject`
commands, deduplicated approvers, a single reject closes an item, deadlines
derived from the deterministic block timestamp. The full decision trail per
item is provable. Use for release gates, payment authorization, cross-org
sign-off.

```yaml
yano.app-chain.state-machine: approvals
```

Use `approvals` when app-chain member keys are intentionally the business
approvers. Do not treat a REST API key or relay member as an employee/auditor
identity. For governed organizations, actor-key revisions, roles,
organization-distinct clauses, portable signatures, and the stock evidence
flow, select the separate `role-evidence` preset for a new chain and follow
[the domain-role guide](APP_CHAIN_DOMAIN_ROLES.md). Existing chains require an
ADR-015 governed profile activation rather than a local YAML switch.

**`balances`** — account balances with `mint` / `transfer` commands: a member
spends only its own account, non-negativity is enforced deterministically in
apply (an overdraft is a no-op on every node), and every balance is a provable
state key. Use for netting, loyalty points, internal credits.

```yaml
yano.app-chain.state-machine: balances
# Optional: restrict minting to one member (32-byte hex Ed25519 key).
# Unset = any member may mint (open mode) — set this for production chains.
yano.app-chain.machines.balances.minter: aa11...
```

Machine settings live under `yano.app-chain.machines.<machine-id>.*` (per
chain: `chains[i].machines.<machine-id>.*`) and must be identical on every
member — they are part of the deterministic apply logic, like the machine id
itself.

**`doc-trail`** — append-only per-entity event trails keyed by an external id
(`productId`, `caseId`, ...): each entry advances a chained head
`blake2b(prevHead ‖ entryHash ‖ author)`, so one proof of the head verifies
the whole ordered trail against the anchored root (a `computeHead` verifier is
provided). Use for DPP/supply-chain trails, case management, evidence chains.

```yaml
yano.app-chain.state-machine: doc-trail
```

Each machine also doubles as a reference implementation for custom ones
(section 6).

---

## 10. Consuming finalized messages (SSE, webhooks, Kafka)

Polling `GET /messages` works, but finalized messages are also pushed.

**SSE** — `GET /app-chain/stream?fromHeight=&topic=` streams finalized
messages: it replays history from `fromHeight` (default: live-only from the
current tip), then follows new blocks. Events are named `app-message` with id
`height:index` (usable as `Last-Event-ID` for resumption); `heartbeat` events
keep idle connections alive; `topic` filters server-side.

```bash
curl -N "http://node:8080/api/v1/app-chain/stream?fromHeight=1&topic=orders"
```

**Webhooks** — `yano.app-chain.webhooks=https://...` (comma-separated; also
per chain). Finalized blocks are POSTed as JSON in height order, at-least-once,
with a persisted per-sink cursor — a restart resumes where delivery left off,
and a failing sink halts and retries rather than skipping blocks. Requests
carry `X-App-Chain-Id` / `X-App-Chain-Height` headers; delivery progress and
the last error appear in `/status` under `sinks`.

**Kafka** — for a JVM node, run `./gradlew :connectors:kafka:shadowJar` and copy the resulting
`yano-x-kafka-<version>-bundle.jar` into
`yano.plugins.directory`. Yano X does not publish a native Kafka connector.

```yaml
yano.app-chain.sinks.kafka.bootstrap-servers: broker:9092
yano.app-chain.sinks.kafka.topic: my-appchain-blocks
yano.app-chain.sinks.kafka.security-profile: tls
yano.app-chain.sinks.kafka.tls.truststore-path: /run/secrets/kafka-trust.p12
yano.app-chain.sinks.kafka.tls.truststore-password: ${KAFKA_TRUSTSTORE_PASSWORD}
yano.app-chain.sinks.kafka.tls.truststore-type: PKCS12
```

Blocks are produced as JSON keyed by stable chain id (partition-stable even
for a multi-partition topic) with
synchronous acks, under the same ordered, at-least-once cursor semantics as
webhooks. The same bundle also contributes the independently configured
`kafka.publish` effect executor described in §18. Configuring the sink does
not activate that executor, and the two contributions own separate producers
and shutdown lifecycles. The sink requires an explicit `local-demo`, `tls`,
`mtls`, or `sasl-tls` profile and shares the executor's strict security fields.
`local-demo` is accepted only for exact localhost or canonical private numeric
bootstrap addresses; remote plaintext and partial sink configuration fail
startup.

**Custom sinks** — implement the `FinalizedStreamSink` SPI; ordering, cursor
persistence and at-least-once redelivery come from the framework
(`yano.app-chain.sinks.<scheme>.*` config is passed through to your sink).
In-process consumers can instead subscribe to `AppBlockFinalizedEvent`
(section 7) or `AppChainGateway.subscribeFinalized`.

Sinks *observe* finalized state. To *act on the outside world* from a finalized
transition (submit a payment, call an API) with a result recorded back
on-chain, use **effects** (section 18) — the outbound counterpart to sinks.

---

## 11. Typed messages (codec)

The framework stays blob-first — codecs live strictly at the edges, so wire
format, proofs and anchoring never depend on your object model.

Client side (`yano-x-client`):

```java
record Order(String id, long qty) {}
CborCodec<Order> codec = CborCodec.of(Order.class);
client.submitTyped("orders", new Order("o-1", 5), codec::encode);
client.subscribeTyped(-1, "orders", codec::decode, (order, msg) -> handle(order));
```

Node side (custom state machines): extend `TypedAppStateMachine<T>` with a
`MessageCodec<T>` — default `JacksonCborCodec`, in core-api — and implement
typed validate/apply instead of parsing bytes yourself. The client `CborCodec`
and the node `JacksonCborCodec` are wire-compatible.

---

## 12. Security (API-key auth, encrypted bodies, external signers/KMS)

**API-key auth** has two modes. Configuring an unscoped full key protects and
enables privileged admin/effect/plugin operations while reads and submissions
remain public. Enabling broad auth additionally protects the whole
`/app-chain/*` REST surface:

```yaml
yano:
  app-chain:
    api:
      # Full-access key plus a topic-scoped submit key:
      keys: "opsKey123,partnerKey456=orders|invoices"
      # Optional: omit this block to leave READ/SUBMIT public.
      auth:
        enabled: true
```

With broad auth enabled, all requests require the `X-API-Key` header. A key
entry of the form `key=topicA|topicB` restricts *submissions* to the listed
topics; reads stay unrestricted per key. This is the only built-in REST auth today — for
mTLS/OIDC put the API behind your standard gateway/reverse-proxy.

**Encrypted bodies** — client-side envelope encryption with a group key; the
chain carries ciphertext only (ordering, proofs and anchors all work over it),
and per-topic keys give need-to-know inside one chain. AES-256-GCM with the
topic as associated data; `GroupCipher` (client SDK) and `BodyCipher`
(core-api, for state machines) share the wire format:

```java
byte[] key = Hex.decode(groupKeyHex);
client.submit("settlement", GroupCipher.encrypt(key, "settlement", plaintext));
byte[] plain = GroupCipher.decrypt(key, "settlement", message.body());
```

**External signers / KMS** — `yano.app-chain.signing-key` accepts a
`scheme:reference` value (e.g. `kms:...`) that routes signing to a
`SignerProviderFactory` plugin, so the member key never sits in a config file;
a bare hex seed keeps the default in-config signer. The SPI is sign-only (no
key export). No KMS/HSM/Vault plugins ship in the distribution yet — the SPI
is the supported integration point.

---

## 13. Compliance (audit/evidence export, retention & pruning)

**Evidence export** — one call produces portable verification material for any
finalized message:

```bash
curl localhost:8080/api/v1/app-chain/chains/<chainId>/evidence/<messageIdHex> \
  > evidence.json
```

The bundle carries the containing block(s), its claimed member set/threshold,
and the L1 anchor reference. An auditor supplies an independently trusted
`EvidenceVerifier.TrustContext`; block hashes and messages-roots are
recomputed, certificates are checked at that pinned m-of-n threshold,
message-id inclusion is confirmed, and the hash chain is linked to the claimed
anchor block. The auditor separately verifies the exact Cardano transaction
output and inline datum. A message newer than the last confirmed anchor yields
a finality-only bundle (`anchor: null`) until the next anchor.

**Retention & pruning** — data minimization with proofs preserved:

```yaml
yano.app-chain.retention.enabled: true
yano.app-chain.retention.keep-blocks: 1000
```

Message **bodies** older than `keep-blocks` and below the last confirmed L1
anchor are stripped; headers, message ids, roots and certificates remain, so
message-id inclusion evidence stays valid while original content verification
is explicitly unavailable. Pruning never runs ahead of
the slowest configured sink (§10), so at-least-once delivery is unaffected.
Combined with encrypted bodies (§12), destroying a topic key is
**crypto-shredding**: content becomes unreadable everywhere while the anchored
evidence trail survives.

---

## 14. Operations (admin API, key rotation runbook, snapshots & onboarding, metrics)

### 14.1 Admin API

`POST /app-chain[/chains/{id}]/admin/...` — always privileged and requires a
configured unscoped full API key (§12):

- `pause` / `resume` — stop/allow **local** REST submissions (peers and
  finalized replication are unaffected).
- `drain-pool` — drop all pending (unfinalized) messages; returns the count.
- `force-anchor` — anchor the current tip now instead of waiting for cadence.

### 14.2 Membership changes

**Governed mode (recommended, ADR 008.3)** — with
`yano.app-chain.membership.mode: governed`, membership changes are **chain
transactions**: the same admin endpoints *submit* a governance command on the
reserved `~governance/membership` topic instead of mutating the local node. A
change activates once **threshold-many members submit the identical command**
(each operator runs ONE call on their own node) and takes effect a few blocks
later, identically on every node. No runbook ordering, no way to be
inconsistent — late joiners and catch-up derive the full membership history
from replay. A half-approved command quietly expires after
`membership.approval-window-blocks` (default 600). Guard rails (below-threshold
removals, invalid thresholds, removing a fixed proposer) void deterministically.
The config member list is the **genesis epoch only**; a member added later
starts with the original genesis list and derives its own membership from the
chain. `POST /admin/members/reset` is a loudly logged local trust-model
deviation for ordinary governed-membership chains and is disabled when a
governed composite profile requires authenticated membership continuity.

**Static mode runbook (default)** — staged and operator-coordinated: run the
SAME steps on EVERY node, in this order. The rotated state persists and
overrides config across restarts (`POST /admin/members/reset` drops the
override and returns to the configured list).

1. **Add the new key everywhere** — on each node:
   `POST /app-chain/admin/members/add {"publicKey":"<newPub>"}`.
   Both old and new keys are now accepted; nothing breaks if nodes are
   momentarily out of step, because the union is accepted during this stage.
2. **Switch the rotating member's signer** — update that node's
   `yano.app-chain.signing-key` to the new seed and restart it. It now signs
   with the new key, which every node already accepts.
3. **(Optional) re-threshold** — `POST /app-chain/admin/threshold
   {"threshold":N}` on every node if the effective member count changed.
4. **Retire the old key everywhere** —
   `POST /app-chain/admin/members/remove {"publicKey":"<oldPub>"}` on each
   node. Guard rails: the configured proposer can't be removed (rotate the
   fixed proposer through an identical config/restart rollout, or select
   rotating sequencing) and the set can't drop below the threshold.

`GET /app-chain/admin/members` shows the effective set + threshold. Use static
mode only when the deployment accepts this operator-coordinated procedure;
new long-lived chains should prefer governed mode.

### 14.3 Snapshots & member onboarding

An atomic ledger snapshot lets a new member start without replaying history:

```bash
curl -XPOST localhost:8080/api/v1/app-chain/snapshot \
     -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"path":"/backups/snap-1"}'
# copy the directory to the new node's app-chain ledger path
# (<resolved yano.app-chain.storage.path>/<chain-id>/), then start it
```

Every snapshot carries a **signed manifest** (`snapshot-manifest.json` +
`.sig`): the snapshotting member signs the chain id, height, tip block hash,
state root, membership-epoch hash, last confirmed anchor and a sha256 of every
file. On first start after a restore the node verifies — *before opening the
database* — that the manifest is signed by a configured member key and that
every file hash matches, then binds the opened ledger to the attested tip
(height, block hash, state root, membership). Any mismatch refuses to start.
A `.manifest-verified` marker skips re-verification on later restarts; legacy
snapshots without a manifest still restore (integrity checks only).

Independently of manifests, **every** start now recomputes the tip block hash
and verifies the tip's finality certificate against membership-at-height — a
ledger whose stored values merely agree with each other no longer passes.

The restored node catches up from the snapshot height over protocol 103.
Snapshots are also the onboarding path past a pruning horizon (§13).

### 14.4 Metrics & health

Standard Quarkus Prometheus endpoint `/q/metrics`, per-chain `chain` tag:
`yano_appchain_tip_height`, `yano_appchain_pool_size`,
`yano_appchain_peers_connected`, `yano_appchain_stalled` (0/1),
`yano_appchain_anchor_lag_blocks`, `yano_appchain_sink_lag_blocks{sink}`
(gauges), `yano_appchain_messages_dropped_total{reason}`,
`yano_appchain_blocks_finalized_total`,
`yano_appchain_messages_finalized_total` (counters),
`yano_appchain_block_interval` (timer).

Effects add `yano_appchain_effects_open`, `queue_depth`, `in_flight`,
`runtime_status{status}`, `result_backlog`,
`result_backlog_by_type{type}`, `oldest_pending_age_blocks`, and
`oldest_pending_age` gauges; `execution_total{outcome}` and `expired_total`
counters; and `execution_latency_seconds{type}`. Status/outcome tags are fixed.
Type tags come only from the bounded `effects.metrics.types` allowlist (plus
`other`), never from arbitrary workload values. Gauges come from a memoized,
non-truncated operational scan and may span a concurrent transition; counters
and timers are normalized to remain monotonic for the life of the node process.

Each lifecycle-owned executor product also contributes cached, node-local
metrics: `executor_readiness{executor,slot,state}` (one-hot),
`executor_in_flight{executor,slot}`,
`executor_age_bucket_seconds{executor,slot,event}`, and monotonic
`executor_attempts_total`, `executor_successes_total`,
`executor_retryable_failures_total`, and `executor_terminal_failures_total`.
The executor inventory is fixed at startup and bounded to 256 products. These
metrics read a host-owned cache; scrapes never invoke plugin code or contact a
connector. Endpoints, credentials, payloads, and plugin-provided labels or
messages are not part of the snapshot contract.

A ready-made Grafana dashboard ships at `docs/grafana/appchain-dashboard.json`.

**Status page**: a built-in dashboard is served at **`/ui/app-chain/`**
(sibling of the L1 node page at `/ui/status/`, cross-linked): chain selector
(multi-chain), role/health pills, tip + membership hero, consensus/pool/
traffic/anchor/sinks/peers panels, four trend charts, a live SSE message feed
and a recent-blocks table. Query params: `?api=` (API prefix), `?poll=` (ms),
`?noanim=1`. When API-key auth is enabled, set the key via the key button
(stored in the browser; the live feed uses fetch-streaming so the key applies
there too). The `?api=` value only tells this app-chain page where to call; it
does not reconfigure server routing and must match the prefix baked into the
artifact. The privileged plugin dashboard at `/ui/plugins/` does not accept
such an override: it uses immutable `/ui/plugins/api-prefix.json` and fails
closed if discovery is missing or invalid. See
[`core-host.md`](core-host.md).

The page also discovers effects and stock state-machine capabilities. Effect
statistics are grouped into queue, lifecycle, outcome, latency, and executor
summaries; the complete bounded response remains available through **Raw
data**. Portable verification keeps expected payload and proof-value digests
separate, supports pasted proof envelopes, and never labels a node-reported
anchor as independently Cardano-verified.

`GET /status` also reports `lastBlockAtMillis`, `blockIntervalMs` (rolling
average), `stalled`, `drops` (by reason), `anchor.lagBlocks` and per-sink
`lagBlocks`.

**Health**: `/q/health/ready` gates only on the subsystem running (peer
connectivity is deliberately excluded — a two-node bootstrap would deadlock).
For operational alerting use the **health group**
`GET /q/health/group/appchain`: DOWN on stall, anchor error, sink delivery
error, or paused submissions, with per-chain data fields.

---

## 15. Query surface

Beyond `/proof` and single-block reads, the finalized ledger is directly
queryable:

- `GET /blocks?from=&limit=` — paged block summaries (height, timestamp,
  state root, message count, cert signatures), ascending; default page is the
  window ending at the tip.
- `GET /messages/{messageIdHex}` — one finalized message: `height`, `index`,
  topic, sender and body.
- `GET /messages/by-topic/{topic}?fromHeight=&limit=` — finalized message
  refs on a topic, ascending `(height, index)`.
- `GET /messages/by-sender/{senderHex}?fromHeight=&limit=` — finalized
  message refs from a member public key, ascending.

Topic and sender indexes are written atomically with each block commit;
blocks finalized before a node upgraded to this feature are not retro-indexed.

---

## 16. Client libraries (Java SDK, Spring Boot starter, testkit)

**Java SDK** (`org.yanoproject:yano-x-client`) — typed access
with client-side proof verification, dependency-light:

```java
AppChainClient client = AppChainClient.builder("http://node:8080/api/v1")
        .chainId("orders-chain").apiKey("...").build();
var result = client.submitText("orders", "order #1");
client.subscribe(-1, "orders", msg -> handle(msg));      // SSE, auto-reconnect
var proof = client.proof(Hex.decode(result.messageId())).orElseThrow();
boolean ok = ProofVerifier.verify(proof, anchoredRootHex); // don't trust, verify
```

The SDK reconnects SSE automatically and dedups replays by `(height, index)`.
`ProofVerifier` checks an MPF proof against an (anchored) root locally —
tampered proofs fail closed.

**Spring Boot starter** (`yano-x-spring-boot-starter`) — the SDK,
Spring-shaped:

```yaml
yano.appchain.client.base-url: http://node:8080/api/v1
yano.appchain.client.chain-id: my-chain     # optional (single-chain node)
yano.appchain.client.api-key: ...           # when the node enables auth
```

```java
@Component
class Orders {
    private final AppChainTemplate appChain;
    Orders(AppChainTemplate appChain) { this.appChain = appChain; }

    void place(String order) {
        String id = appChain.send("orders", order);
        appChain.verifiedMessageProof(id);   // fetch + verify MPF proof locally
    }

    @AppChainListener(topic = "orders")     // finalized messages, SSE, auto-reconnect
    void onOrder(String body) { ... }
}
```

Listener methods take `StreamedMessage`, `byte[]` or `String`; all beans are
`@ConditionalOnMissingBean`, so anything can be overridden.

**Testkit** (`org.yanoproject:yano-appchain-core-testkit`, test scope) —
embedded multi-node chains for CI: generated keys, real sockets, temp ledgers:

```java
@AppChainCluster(nodes = 3)
class OrderFlowTest {
    @Test
    void replicates(AppChainClusterHandle cluster) throws Exception {
        String id = cluster.node(1).submit("orders", body);
        cluster.awaitFinalized(id);
    }
}
```

**Scaffolds** — `scaffolds/docker-compose-cluster` (ready 3-node cluster) and
`scaffolds/plugin-template` (custom state-machine plugin Gradle project).

---

## 17. Zero-knowledge extensions (EXPERIMENTAL)

All ZK ships as one **experimental** plugin, `yano-x-zk` (depends on
ZeroJ). A JVM node can deploy the self-contained
`yano-x-zk-<version>-bundle.jar` produced by
`:state-machines:zk:shadowJar`; no adjacent ZeroJ JARs are needed or accepted as the
same catalog-v1 bundle. Yano X does not publish a native ZK extension. The node only
**verifies** proofs — proving happens
client-side, where the secrets live. Circuits are
chain configuration: each `circuitId → VK hash` is pinned and loaded
fail-closed at startup, and every member enforces verification in `apply()`
(consensus-critical, not just admission).

**Private-predicate admission (`state-machine=zk-gate`).** Messages carry an
in-body proof; the chain finalizes a message only if it verifies. The
predicate — "amount ≤ limit", "age ≥ 18", "KYC holds" — lives entirely in the
proof; the chain (and the other members) never see the underlying data.

```yaml
yano.app-chain.state-machine: zk-gate
yano.app-chain.zk.circuits[0].id: credit-limit
yano.app-chain.zk.circuits[0].vk-file: /etc/yano/credit-limit.vk
yano.app-chain.zk.circuits[0].vk-hash: <blake2b-256 hex of the vk file>
yano.app-chain.zk.circuits[0].proof-system: groth16     # or plonk
yano.app-chain.zk.circuits[0].curve: bls12381
```

**Anchored verifiable credentials (`state-machine=credential-registry`).**
Records are issuer-BBS-signed attribute sets; the chain admits one only if the
issuer signature verifies (issuers are configured trust anchors, decoupled
from membership) and records a provable commitment. A holder later discloses
*selected fields* with a derived proof, verified against the issuer key and
the anchored record.

```yaml
yano.app-chain.state-machine: credential-registry
yano.app-chain.zk.bbs.issuers[0].id: hr-dept
yano.app-chain.zk.bbs.issuers[0].public-key: <BBS G2 public-key hex>
```

**Anonymous-but-authorized submissions (`state-machine=zk-membership`).**
The author proves membership in the registered set instead of signing with an
identifiable key; a one-time nullifier prevents double-action (deterministic
dedup in `apply()`, committed in MPF state). Anonymous voting, sealed bids,
whistleblowing among known members. Uses the same `zk.circuits[...]` config
for the membership circuit. Note: the transport envelope still carries the
relaying node's signature — the logical author is anonymous within the member
set; a fully anonymous transport scheme is a planned follow-up.

> Experimental: ZeroJ is unaudited and Groth16 has trusted-setup operational
> needs; prefer `plonk` (universal setup) for enterprise deployments. Proving
> and disclosure helpers (`BbsCredentials`, proof generation) currently live
> in the plugin.

---

## 18. Effects — acting on the outside world

Everything so far keeps state *inside* the chain. **Effects** (ADR-010) let a
finalized state transition trigger an action *outside* it — submit a Cardano
payment, call an ERP/webhook, pin to IPFS, issue a credential — without
breaking determinism.

The rule that makes it safe: **a state machine never performs the action, it
emits a record describing it.** Emission is part of deterministic `apply()`,
identical on every member and transitively committed through the count-bound
`effectsRoot` leaf into the state root. A separate
**Effect Runtime** (outside consensus, on one designated node or an external
worker) executes finalized effects, and the outcome comes back as an ordinary
sequenced message that the machine records. The guarantee is **exactly-once
incorporation, at-least-once execution** — the external action may run more
than once (so executors must be idempotent), but its outcome lands in chain
state exactly once.

```
apply()  ── emit ──▶  effect record (outbox + effectsRoot, provable, anchored)
                          │  finalized
                          ▼
                 Effect Runtime ── execute ──▶  external system
                          │
        ~fx/result (member-signed, sequenced) ──▶ apply() records the outcome
```

### 18.1 Enable effects

Consensus-affecting — **every member must set the same values** (a mismatch
diverges the state root, exactly like a mismatched state machine). Effects are
off by default.

```yaml
yano.app-chain.effects.enabled: true
# Deterministic caps (consensus parameters):
yano.app-chain.effects.max-per-block: 256          # effects one block may emit
yano.app-chain.effects.max-payload-bytes: 16384    # per-effect payload cap
yano.app-chain.effects.max-expiry-blocks: 100000
yano.app-chain.effects.result-window-blocks: 100000 # results incorporable within this window
# Where an effect's outcome is committed in the trie:
yano.app-chain.effects.outcome-commitment: per-effect  # per-effect | per-block
# Default finality gate for emitted effects (see §18.4):
yano.app-chain.effects.default-gate: app-final     # app-final | l1-anchored | zk-settled
```

Enabling effects reserves the `~fx/` key prefix in the state trie (a state
machine may not write keys starting with `~fx/`). This reservation holds from
genesis regardless of the flag, so effects can be turned on later without
colliding with historical state.

### 18.2 Emit effects from a state machine

Override the three-argument `apply` and call `effects.emit(...)`. The emitter
records intent — it performs no I/O, and everything forbidden in `apply()`
(wall clock, randomness, network) stays forbidden.

```java
public class OrderStateMachine implements AppStateMachine {
    @Override public String id() { return "orders"; }

    @Override
    public void apply(AppBlock block, AppStateWriter writer, AppEffectEmitter effects) {
        for (AppMessage m : block.messages()) {
            Order o = decode(m.getBody());
            writer.put(key(o.id()), o.toBytes());          // ordinary state
            if (o.isApproved()) {
                effects.emit(EffectIntent.of("webhook.post", o.fulfilmentJson())
                        .scope("orders/" + o.id())         // app-level idempotency scope
                        .result(ResultPolicy.CHAIN)        // outcome comes back on-chain
                        .gate(FinalityGate.CHAIN_DEFAULT)  // use the chain's default gate
                        .expiryBlocks(1000)                // deterministic timeout (see §18.4)
                        .sourceMessageId(m.getMessageId())
                        .build());
            }
        }
    }

    // Called deterministically when a CHAIN effect's outcome is incorporated.
    @Override
    public void onEffectResult(AppBlock block, EffectResult result, AppStateWriter writer) {
        if (!result.scope().startsWith("orders/")) return;
        String id = result.scope().substring("orders/".length());
        // result.confirmed(), result.outcome() (CONFIRMED/FAILED/CANCELLED/EXPIRED),
        // result.externalRef() (e.g. a tx hash) — committed transitively by the
        // configured outcome root; values written here also enter application state.
        writer.put(fulfilledKey(id), result.externalRef());
    }
}
```

`EffectIntent` fields: **type** (routes to an executor), **payload** (opaque
bytes — never put secrets or PII here; records are replicated and committed),
**scope** (your idempotency handle), **gate** (§18.4), **result**
(`CHAIN` = outcome fed back and delivered to `onEffectResult`; `NONE` =
fire-and-forget, operator-visible only), **expiryBlocks**. Effect ids are
deterministic — `chainId/height/ordinal`, hashed into the idempotency key
handed to every external system.

### 18.3 Run an executor

The Effect Runtime is **off by default** — turn it on where you want effects
to actually run (typically one node, or a dedicated executor node). Everywhere
else, effects are still emitted and provable; they just wait.

```yaml
yano.app-chain.effects.executor.enabled: true      # this node executes effects
yano.app-chain.effects.executor.types: ""          # empty = all; or "cardano.payment,webhook.post"
# Optional stable override; must be unique per physical executor and survive key rotation:
# yano.app-chain.effects.executor.identity: payments-executor-sg-1
yano.app-chain.effects.executor.tick-ms: 2000
yano.app-chain.effects.executor.max-parallel: 4
yano.app-chain.effects.executor.max-attempts: 8    # then PARKED for operator review
yano.app-chain.effects.executor.backoff-initial-ms: 2000
yano.app-chain.effects.executor.backoff-max-ms: 300000
yano.app-chain.effects.metrics.types: "cardano.payment,webhook.post" # max 32; empty = aggregate only
yano.app-chain.effects.retention.keep-blocks: 100000   # prune resolved effect records
```

Run it on **exactly one node** (or partition types across nodes with
`executor.types`) — the runtime provides no cross-node mutual exclusion by
design; overlap degrades to duplicate *attempts*, which idempotency absorbs.
A late-enabled executor **quarantines** historical open effects rather than
blind-firing them; requeue via REST. Failed effects retry with backoff, then
**park** (never block other effects) for an operator to requeue or cancel.

Runtime attempts, leases, submitted references and the intake cursor are bound
to a fixed-size canonical fingerprint of the executor identity and sorted type
partition. Moving a checkpoint to a different executor, changing
`executor.identity`, changing `executor.types`, or upgrading a legacy
checkpoint with no owner binding discards only that node-local runtime state
and quarantines every historical open effect. Consensus effect records,
closures and state roots are preserved. Review and explicitly requeue each
obligation; an already-submitted external action may otherwise be attempted
again, so executor-side idempotency remains mandatory.

**Built-in `webhook.post` executor** — POSTs the payload with an
`Idempotency-Key` header (the effect's id hash); the target URL lives in
config, not the payload:

```yaml
yano.app-chain.effects.executors.webhook.url: https://erp.example/hooks/yano
yano.app-chain.effects.executors.webhook.timeout-ms: 10000
```

**Kafka publish executor** — the optional `yano-x-kafka` bundle also
handles canonical-CBOR `kafka.publish` effects. Payloads select stable target
and topic aliases; broker endpoints, TLS/SASL credentials, and physical topic
names remain executor-local configuration:

```yaml
yano.app-chain.effects.executors.kafka.targets.primary.target-id: primary-v1
yano.app-chain.effects.executors.kafka.targets.primary.bootstrap-servers: broker:9092
yano.app-chain.effects.executors.kafka.targets.primary.acks: all
yano.app-chain.effects.executors.kafka.targets.primary.security-profile: local-demo
yano.app-chain.effects.executors.kafka.topics.evidence-ready.target: primary
yano.app-chain.effects.executors.kafka.topics.evidence-ready.name: evidence.available.v1
```

The shown `local-demo` profile is plaintext and accepts only local/private
bootstrap hosts. Non-local brokers require the validated `tls`, `mtls`, or
`sasl-tls` profile and its trust/key configuration.

With no Kafka executor settings, or with `enabled: false`, the effect
contribution remains inactive even when the finalized sink is configured.

A confirmation records the destination fingerprint, partition, and offset.
The effect id is injected as lowercase hex in the reserved
`yano-effect-id` header for consumer deduplication. The other frozen v1
headers are `yano-chain-id` (UTF-8), `yano-effect-type`,
`yano-payload-version`, `yano-origin-height`, `yano-origin-ordinal`, and
`yano-content-type` (US-ASCII). Payloads cannot supply a `yano-*` header.
Kafka producer idempotence does not guarantee cross-process exactly-once
delivery after an acknowledgement is lost, so consumers must still
deduplicate where duplicates matter. The frozen payload/receipt schemas,
CDDL, and golden vectors ship in `yano-x-integration-contracts`.

**S3-compatible object executor** — the optional
`yano-x-objectstore-s3` bundle handles canonical `object.put` effects.
The document is pre-staged under an allowlisted source prefix; the command
commits its exact SHA-256 digest and size, while credentials, endpoints,
buckets, encryption, and retention policy stay in the selected target. The
executor verifies the source and uses conditional creation of an immutable,
versioned destination—it does not overwrite or resurrect a conflicting key.
See the module README for the full required target profile and S3-compatible/AWS
examples.

**IPFS pin executor** — the optional `yano-x-ipfs` bundle handles
canonical `ipfs.pin` effects against a configured Kubo node. It pins a known
CID only: it never accepts document bytes or a caller-selected endpoint, and
it never hides CID/chunking choices inside the executor.

```yaml
yano.app-chain.effects.executors.ipfs.enabled: true
yano.app-chain.effects.executors.ipfs.targets.local.target-id: local-kubo-v1
yano.app-chain.effects.executors.ipfs.targets.local.api-url: http://127.0.0.1:5001
yano.app-chain.effects.executors.ipfs.targets.local.security-profile: local-demo
yano.app-chain.effects.executors.ipfs.targets.local.allowed-codecs: raw,dag-pb
yano.app-chain.effects.executors.ipfs.targets.local.recursive: true
yano.app-chain.effects.executors.ipfs.targets.local.replication-policy: demo-single
yano.app-chain.effects.executors.ipfs.targets.local.connect-timeout-ms: 1000
yano.app-chain.effects.executors.ipfs.targets.local.request-timeout-ms: 5000
yano.app-chain.effects.executors.ipfs.targets.local.close-timeout-ms: 1000
```

The Kubo RPC is an administrative interface and must remain private. A
confirmed pin is a point-in-time report from the configured target, not proof
of indefinite global availability or content confidentiality. See
`connectors/ipfs/README.md` for TLS/bearer configuration,
packaging, policy, and real-Kubo test instructions.

### Deterministic composite state machines

Select the first-party stock composition when one chain needs registry,
approval, document-trail, and evidence publication semantics in one atomic
state root:

```yaml
yano:
  app-chain:
    effects:
      enabled: true
      max-per-block: 128
    chains:
      - id: evidence-chain
        state-machine: composite
        machines:
          composite:
            preset: evidence-v1-gated
            profile-mode: governed
        membership:
          mode: governed
```

The profile, ordered components, routes, activations, workflows, query limits,
and quotas are canonically committed under `~composite/profile/v1`. The
generic `composite` selector is therefore not a sufficient proof identity.
Clients must pin the intended domain-separated profile digest, prove that
marker, map logical keys through `CompositeCommitmentV1.componentKey(...)`, and
verify the marker and component leaves at the same height/root. The typed
evidence client performs this sequence and exposes both logical and physical
proof keys.

Custom compositions are ordinary ADR-011 manifested state-machine bundles.
Use `ComposableAppStateMachine.builder(...)` to register ordinary
`AppStateMachine` instances with explicit component descriptors and optional
declared workflows, then export the resulting machine's distinct id from the
provider and manifest. The builder generates the canonical profile and checks
component/workflow reservations against the real `effects.max-per-block`.
There is no second component lifecycle SPI or state-machine adapter. Do not
publish arbitrary profiles under the stock `composite` identity.

Replacement generations may change a committed `configurationId` only while
retaining the same `stateAndResultCompatibilityId`. Generations with one
component id share a physical namespace and may receive late results, so a
state schema or callback-contract change requires a new component id plus a
deterministic migration/workflow, or a fresh chain. Admission changes likewise
use new versioned topics/query paths.

For long-lived new chains, `profile-mode: governed` commits an authenticated
profile epoch chain. A reviewed bundle may package current and dormant target
catalog entries; members deploy that bundle first, then separately approve and
attest readiness for exact target bytes and a future activation height. Local
YAML/JAR changes never activate semantics. Existing retained fixed chains
cannot switch modes by configuration. See the
[profile-governance operator runbook](APP_CHAIN_PROFILE_GOVERNANCE.md).

The composite provides deterministic isolation and atomic coordination; it
does not add DPP actor policy, regulatory validation, or real-world truth. The
default `evidence-v1-gated` preset exposes only the coordinated
`evidence.release.v1` creation/republish path. Its command-granular
`evidence.command.v1` route accepts only canonical post-publication
notifications. The compatibility `evidence-v1` preset exposes every direct
evidence command; there the release workflow is optional orchestration rather
than a mandatory authorization gate.
See the [composite module guide](../composition/runtime/README.md),
[lightweight contracts guide](../composition/contracts/README.md),
and [ADR-013.2](../adr/app-layer/013.2-deterministic-composite-state-machine.md).

**No-code evidence demo** — the
[ADR-013 evidence-effects demo](../products/evidence/harness/README.md) wires
the Kafka, S3-compatible object-store, and IPFS connectors into one
three-member devnet workflow. It stages an inspection certificate, commits its
digest, archives and pins the exact bytes, publishes the result-gated event,
and verifies deterministic state, proofs, receipts, and a Cardano script
anchor. The same scenario runs through Docker Compose or ordinary host-started
Yano processes; no state-machine or plugin code is required. Its launcher also
demonstrates both legacy explicit and activated direct continuation, retained
restart, explicit executor ownership, guarded cleanup,
private credential files, and the preview/preprod/mainnet safety profiles.
While one cluster remains running, `demo.sh publish` creates version 1 for a
new evidence ID, `demo.sh republish --business-version N` creates only the
exact next immutable version, `demo.sh verify` checks latest or historical
state and connector observations without submitting a message, and
`demo.sh replay` explicitly demonstrates the deterministic no-op boundary.
The compatibility command `demo.sh run` publishes an absent ID, verifies
matching retained bytes, and returns `REPUBLISH_REQUIRED` for changed content.
`demo.sh load --count N --concurrency C --id-prefix P` publishes bounded,
independent version-1 IDs through the same full workflow. Lifecycle mode is
the default: each worker completes an entire item. Optional
`--load-mode pipeline --max-in-flight M` keeps bounded prepare, prerequisite,
approval, release, effects, and verify stages busy across different IDs. It
does not bypass application rules, finality, connector reconciliation, proofs,
or anchoring. The stock profile commits eight releases per block and derives
its release, notification, component, and total effect quotas from that value;
the capacity is authenticated profile identity rather than local tuning.
The runner accepts up to 50,000 items per invocation and 5,000 in-flight
workflow items. In-flight workflows are not a 1:1 mempool-message measure:
each workflow submits several messages across finality-separated stages.

The schema-v2 aggregate records app-message, release, effect, and fully
verified workflow rates, per-stage metrics, in-flight observations, latency
percentiles, and stable failure counts. It is a functional capacity/soak tool
rather than a raw consensus benchmark. L1-gated devnet loads use the existing
force-anchor action through a shared throttle; ordinary commands are
unchanged. Load is disabled for public anchor-enabled profiles to avoid
implicit spending. The disposable devnet scripted anchor remains supported.
See the demo README for complete commands and safe sample-file handling.
The self-contained Compose profile pulls the official digest-pinned,
multi-architecture RustFS beta image selected by ADR-013; Yano does not build
RustFS, Kafka, or Kubo from source. The image is used only as the local
S3-compatible demonstration service. Compose configuration disables RustFS's
upstream startup version check, so the demo does not make that outbound
request. The launcher uses RustFS's built-in
full-admin root only inside the provider and one-shot private bootstrap, then
applies and verifies separate least-privilege runner and executor identities,
an empty service/STS-key inventory, encrypted IAM state, bucket versioning,
and Object Lock. There is deliberately no canned policy for the built-in root,
because RustFS does not enforce one on its owner identity; the fixed one-shot
code, private secret mounts, and isolated connector network are that
administrative path's actual boundaries. Only the runner and executor policies
are described as IAM-enforced. This remains neither a production nor a
high-availability object-storage recommendation.
Host deployment stays provider-neutral and can target
an independently qualified AWS S3 or compatible service without changing the
effect contract or scenario.

**Cardano payment executor** — a JVM node can run
`:connectors:effects-cardano:shadowJar` and copy
`yano-x-effects-cardano-<version>-bundle.jar` into the plugins
directory. Yano X does not publish a native Cardano payment connector. It handles
`cardano.payment` effects with a
`{"to": <bech32>, "lovelace": <n>, "memo"?: <str>}` payload, stamps the effect
id into tx metadata, and confirms by tx hash. Secrets live here, never in
payloads:

```yaml
yano.app-chain.effects.executors.cardano.backend-url: http://localhost:8080/api/v1/    # Blockfrost-compatible
yano.app-chain.effects.executors.cardano.signing-mnemonic: "<payer wallet mnemonic>"   # or signing-account-key
yano.app-chain.effects.executors.cardano.network: preprod                              # mainnet|preprod|preview
yano.app-chain.effects.executors.cardano.metadata-label: 21042
yano.app-chain.effects.executors.cardano.max-lovelace-per-tx: 500000000               # blast-radius cap (0 = uncapped)
```

> **Fund the payer wallet conservatively** and set `max-lovelace-per-tx`: a
> buggy or compromised machine that emits an oversized payment cannot then
> drain the hot wallet in one tx.

**Stdlib approvals → generic effect** — no state-machine code is needed. The
`approvals` machine can emit one exact effect type on final approval. The item
decision remains `APPROVED`; a separate provable effect record moves from
`PENDING` to `CONFIRMED` or `FAILED`. Using `cardano.payment` routes the opaque
proposal payload to the Cardano payment executor.

```yaml
yano.app-chain.state-machine: approvals
yano.app-chain.effects.enabled: true
yano.app-chain.machines.approvals.on-approved-effect.enabled: true
yano.app-chain.machines.approvals.on-approved-effect.type: cardano.payment
yano.app-chain.machines.approvals.on-approved-effect.gate: l1-anchored
yano.app-chain.machines.approvals.on-approved-effect.expiry-blocks: 1000
yano.app-chain.machines.approvals.activations.on-approved-effect: 1
```

The generic type can instead be `webhook.post`, `kafka.publish`, `object.put`,
`ipfs.pin`, or a custom plugin routing type. Configuration selects one action;
multiple or conditional actions belong in a composite/custom state machine.

### 18.4 Finality gates and expiry

A **gate** decides when an emitted effect becomes eligible to execute:

- **`app-final`** — as soon as the block is committed (the chain is
  append-only after finality, so the emission is already irrevocable).
- **`l1-anchored`** — once the effect's height is covered by an L1-confirmed,
  stability-deep anchor (the emission is provable against Cardano before you
  act). A verifiability delay, not a rollback safeguard.
- **`zk-settled`** — once covered by an accepted validity proof (reserved for
  the ZK settlement roadmap, §17; waits until expiry on non-ZK chains).

`l1-anchored` needs anchoring enabled (§5) and `l1.stability-depth` set.
`effects.gate.anchor-margin-blocks` adds a safety margin above the anchor
high-water-mark.

**Expiry is mandatory for CHAIN effects** — a result arriving after the result
window is a deterministic no-op, so every CHAIN effect must provably close. If
you pass `expiryBlocks(0)` the framework defaults it to the result window. When
the expiry height passes with no incorporated result, the effect deterministically
becomes **EXPIRED** (delivered to `onEffectResult`) — the "nobody answered in
time" escape hatch, distinct from **FAILED** ("the target answered no").

### 18.5 The result path and trust

Executed `CHAIN` outcomes re-enter as member-signed `~fx/result` messages,
sequenced like any other. The framework interpreter is fail-closed and
first-result-wins: duplicate, late, malformed, unknown, or out-of-window
results are deterministic no-ops — **a result can never stall the chain.** A
result is a *member attestation*, not an independently verified fact (followers
check the signature and membership, not the external world). Narrow who may
attest with a designated-signer list:

```yaml
# Only these member keys' ~fx/result messages are accepted (default: any member):
yano.app-chain.effects.result.signers: "<hex pubkey of the executor node>"
```

For L1-visible facts (a payment landing), prefer verifying via an L1 observer
(§ config `observers`) over trusting an attestation. `k`-of-`n` result
attestation for high-value effects is designed, not yet shipped.

### 18.6 External executors (claim / report)

To run execution *outside* Yano — a different team, language, or a worker that
holds secrets Yano shouldn't — enable external mode and drive it over REST or
the Java SDK. The node leases effects to a named worker; the worker executes
and reports the outcome, which the node re-signs into a `~fx/result`.

```yaml
yano.app-chain.effects.executor.enabled: true
yano.app-chain.effects.external.enabled: true
```

```java
AppChainClient client = ...;
JsonNode claimed = client.claimEffects("worker-1", List.of("cardano.payment"), 16, 60);
for (JsonNode e : claimed.get("effects")) {
    long height = e.get("height").asLong();
    int ordinal = e.get("ordinal").asInt();
    byte[] idKey = HexUtil.decodeHexString(e.get("idempotencyKey").asText());
    byte[] txHash = executeExternally(e.get("payloadHex").asText(), idKey);  // pass idKey to the target
    client.reportEffect("worker-1", height, ordinal, /*success*/ true, txHash, null);
}
```

Leases are wall-clock and node-local; an expired lease re-opens the effect for
failover. Reports are fenced to the lease holder.

> **Security**: `requeue`/`cancel`/`claim`/`report` move funds or change
> consensus-visible state — they are **privileged**: a submit-only
> (topic-restricted) API key may not call them; only a full key can (§12).
> Configure an unscoped `yano.app-chain.api.keys` full key and keep the
> executor/operator REST surface on a trusted network. Broad READ/SUBMIT auth
> is optional; privileged operations always fail closed without the full key.

### 18.7 Write a custom executor

Any effect type your machines emit can be handled by a plugin implementing two
interfaces — the same ServiceLoader pattern as custom sinks (§10):

```java
public class CredentialIssueExecutor implements AppEffectExecutor {
    private final String issuerUrl;
    private final EffectExecutorOperationsTracker operations =
            new EffectExecutorOperationsTracker();
    CredentialIssueExecutor(Map<String, String> config) {
        this.issuerUrl = config.get("issuer-url");
    }

    @Override public String id() { return "credential-issuer"; }
    @Override public Set<String> effectTypes() { return Set.of("credential.issue"); }
    @Override public boolean supports(String type) { return "credential.issue".equals(type); }

    @Override
    public EffectExecution execute(EffectExecutionContext ctx, PendingEffect effect) throws Exception {
        return operations.observeChecked(() -> executeAttempt(ctx, effect));
    }

    private EffectExecution executeAttempt(EffectExecutionContext ctx, PendingEffect effect)
            throws Exception {
        CredentialRequest request = decodeCredentialRequest(effect.payload());
        // MUST be idempotent on effect.idHash() — the same effect may re-run.
        // ctx.submittedRef() is non-empty on a re-poll of a prior Submitted;
        // probe by it instead of acting again.
        byte[] credentialId = issue(issuerUrl, request, effect.idHash());
        return EffectExecution.confirmed(credentialId);          // or .failed(reason, retryable),
                                                                 // .submitted(ref), .retry(duration)
    }

    @Override public EffectExecutorOperationalSnapshot operationalSnapshot() {
        return operations.snapshot();
    }
}

public class CredentialExecutorFactory implements AppEffectExecutorFactory {
    @Override public String scheme() { return "credential"; }   // config ns: effects.executors.credential.*
    @Override public List<AppEffectExecutor> create(String chainId, Map<String, String> config) {
        return config.containsKey("issuer-url")
                ? List.of(new CredentialIssueExecutor(config)) : List.of();
    }
}
```

Register it via
`META-INF/services/org.yanoproject.api.appchain.effects.AppEffectExecutorFactory`
(one line: the factory's fully-qualified name), and add
`META-INF/yano/plugins/com.example.credential.json`:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "id": "com.example.credential",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "yanoApi": { "min": 1, "max": 1, "minLevel": 1 },
  "dependencies": [],
  "contributions": [
    {
      "kind": "effect-executor",
      "name": "credential",
      "provider": "com.example.credential.CredentialExecutorFactory"
    }
  ]
}
```

The manifest name must equal its bundle id, and its contribution must match
the ServiceLoader entry and the factory's `scheme()` exactly. For JVM
directory deployment, package the provider and all non-host runtime
dependencies in one self-contained bundle JAR, drop that JAR in the plugin
directory, and configure
`yano.app-chain.effects.executors.credential.issuer-url=...`. Adjacent thin dependency
JARs are separate catalog artifacts, not one bundle. A native deployment must
include and map the manifested bundle at application build time; an existing
native executable cannot load it from the plugin directory.

`effectTypes()` is the authoritative ownership declaration for new executors.
Startup fails before publication if two products declare the same type. The
default empty declaration preserves legacy predicate-based executors, but new
plugins should not rely on discovery order. `operationalSnapshot()` is
optional and defaults to a bounded `UNKNOWN` view; the helper shown above
maintains secret-free fixed counters and age/failure classes without exposing
the connector client.

The framework supplies discovery, finality gating, retries, backoff, the
poison lane, and the result loop — you implement only the one attempt.
Contract: **idempotent on `idHash`**, secrets from config not payloads,
`Confirmed`/`Failed` are definitive, `Submitted` re-polls, throwing means
retry.

Factory schemes are exact and case-sensitive. Sink/effect schemes cannot
contain `.` because the first dot separates the scheme from its configuration
key; signer schemes cannot contain `:` because it separates the key reference.

### 18.8 REST surface

Chain-scoped under `/app-chain/chains/{chainId}/...` (single-chain alias
`/app-chain/...`):

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET effects?fromHeight=&limit=` | emitted effect records (consensus view) |
| `GET effects/{height}/{ordinal}` | one effect + this node's execution status |
| `GET effects/{height}/{ordinal}/proof` | composed record → effects root → historical state-root proof |
| `GET effects/stats` | non-truncated memoized backlog/status/oldest-age plus execution, expiry and latency totals |
| `POST effects/{height}/{ordinal}/requeue` | operator: PARKED/QUARANTINED → PENDING |
| `POST effects/{height}/{ordinal}/cancel?reason=` | operator: cancel an open CHAIN effect |
| `POST effects/claim` | external executor: lease effects |
| `POST effects/{height}/{ordinal}/report` | external executor: report an outcome |

The proof endpoint returns the canonical record CBOR, its ordered Merkle path,
and an MPF proof of `~fx/root/<height>` against that block's historical state
root. Verify it locally with `EffectProofVerifier`, preferably supplying a
state root independently obtained from the certified block at exactly that
emission height:

```java
var lookup = client.effectProof(height, ordinal);
if (lookup.available()) {
    boolean valid = EffectProofVerifier.verifyFor(
            lookup.proof(), stateRootAtEmissionHeight, chainId, height, ordinal);
}
```

An L1 anchor root can be supplied directly only when it anchors that exact
height. For a later anchor, authenticate block H through its threshold
certificate and the certified hash chain to the anchored descendant first;
the MPF proof itself is deliberately against `stateRoot(H)`.

`404` means no such effect/ordinal according to the retained index. `410
EFFECT_PROOF_PRUNED` is an availability signal from this node: its compact
metadata says one or more records needed to reconstruct the path passed
`effects.retention.keep-blocks`. A 410 is not itself a portable proof that the
ordinal existed; only a successfully verified composed proof establishes that.
Archive proofs before that horizon when long-lived portable evidence is
required; a proof already obtained remains verifiable forever.

---

## 19. Troubleshooting

- **`/status` is your dashboard**: `role`, `tipHeight`, `stateRoot`,
  `poolSize` (pending messages), per-peer connectivity, `anchor` progress,
  sink cursors.
- **Node won't start**: "public key ... not in the configured member list" —
  fix `members`/`signing-key`; "Unknown app-chain state machine" — wrong
  `state-machine` id or plugin jar not in the plugins directory.
- **Chain-less REST returns 400**: the node hosts more than one chain — use
  `/app-chain/chains/{chainId}/...` (section 8).
- **Messages accepted but no blocks**: check that exactly one node has the
  `sequencer.proposer` key **and is running**, that `threshold` ≤ member
  count, and that enough members are connected to co-sign. A
  `AppChainStalledEvent` (and warning log) fires when a peer's tip is ahead
  with no local progress for 60s.
- **Submissions return "paused"**: an operator called `/admin/pause` —
  `/admin/resume` re-opens local submissions (section 14).
- **Member behind / fresh member joining**: automatic — it catches up over
  protocol 103 from any connected peer, verifying certificates and state
  roots block by block. For long histories, restore a snapshot first (§14.3).
- **Proposer down**: submissions still replicate. In fixed mode, no new block
  finalizes until that proposer returns. In rotating mode, progress resumes in
  a window whose scheduled proposer is available; there is no general BFT
  view-change protocol. Restart is safe: vote locks are persisted and finalized
  history is immutable.
- **L1 impact**: none — the app protocols are invisible to non-Yano peers
  (capability negotiated in the handshake; a Haskell node simply never
  selects it). Run the `test-haskell-sync` skill for the standard L1
  compatibility regression.

## 20. Current limitations

- Permissioned membership is implemented; public/stake-based validator sets,
  slashing, and open participation are not.
- Fixed and L1-clocked rotating proposer modes are implemented. Rotating mode
  is schedule-based, not a general BFT view-change protocol, and anchor-leader
  failover remains an operator action.
- Both static/operator-coordinated and chain-governed membership are
  implemented. Profile governance cannot recover a lost membership-governance
  threshold or bypass membership authority.
- Metadata and threshold-co-signed script anchors are implemented. They commit
  and enforce the anchor chain; they do not by themselves implement a
  domain-specific bridge or withdrawal validator.
- Effect results are member attestations, not independent proof that an
  external system told the truth. Co-attestation policy epochs and a continuous
  independent outcome auditor remain future controls required before claiming
  semi-trusted-member support.
- The Cardano payment executor is a preview/tightly capped-wallet profile; use
  no material funds until the production transaction/reconciliation hardening
  tracked as `FX-002` is complete.
- REST protection is API-key only (section 12); use standard gateway
  infrastructure for mTLS/OIDC.
- All ZK extensions are experimental (section 17) and never on a default code
  path.
